[2022-06-27T15:11:58.538Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: I can jump in here Simona that's okay yeah it smells yes I understand it sorry I was a little late so I don't know what all the the setup was but soulbound tokens as their kind of conceived of right now are largely in Ft based I guess there is a little bit of Need for clarity around people think.\
[2022-06-27T15:11:58.904Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny:  if people think that's old.\
[2022-06-27T15:12:21.291Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	s/ in Ft /NFT\
[2022-06-27T15:12:31.167Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: Tokens are necessarily in Ft based but they're intended to be kind of have a different way of being transferred so they're not transferable just all over the place like a regular nft but they are a token that is transferable to other accounts based on some other logic and its intended to not be transferable to another human right so a human might have multiple ethereum addresses or.\
[2022-06-27T15:12:31.525Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny:  or some other chain addresses and you only want.\
[2022-06-27T15:12:52.064Z]	<Phil_T3>	present+\
[2022-06-27T15:13:02.127Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: That soulbound token to be transferred to other accounts or addresses that are mutually controlled by some actor some human and the idea here is that these in ft's can contain some amount of data that is about an individual you've seen there's you know good ideas or at least non-offensive ideas I think for what type of data might be in a soulbound token stuff like membership to adapt to or something like.\
[2022-06-27T15:13:02.448Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny:  like that.\

[2022-06-27T15:13:34.869Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: And then there's other bad ideas which I think we could talk about which are the idea that you might put a medical record or citizenship or something that has pii in it into this in ft and the whole purpose of this there's like lots of other kind of ideas that surround this but one of the big Ideas is that now you can bring a piece of your identity and your reputation to some on chain logic smart contracts for instance to do certain things.\
[2022-06-27T15:13:35.212Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny:  right and gives us some level of.\

[2022-06-27T15:13:41.779Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: That's how I understand the state of soulbound tokens right now.\
[2022-06-27T15:14:51.045Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: I'm happy to hop in and and discuss thank you so much so and thank you also for creating a forum for us to continue this this discussion I think it's been so fruitful this far so to recap for those of us who might not have joined us in our most recent conversation we actually had a wonderful opportunity to discuss with Pooja the co-author of this paper her intention and objectives in in pursuing this conjecture so she really articulated her interest in multi-party computation.\
[2022-06-27T15:15:24.722Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: Data that is created by multiple parties in collaboration so it was really wonderful to learn that she actually shares some of the objectives and interests of those on on this call and those who have been working their identity space for a while and that actually is some of the objective she was looking to achieve can can be successfully achieved using verifiable credentials so we agreed that there actually might be some better implementation details than those proposed in this initial paper.\
[2022-06-27T15:15:25.198Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin:  / that might be more uniquely well-suited to the objectives that.\
[2022-06-27T15:15:28.185Z]	<Matthieu_Coll\'e9>	present+\
[2022-06-27T15:15:56.261Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: Into to pursue so it was really wonderful to learn that you know not only do we have a shared of a shared set of goals but we also agree that the implementation details discussed might not actually be the best when we think about the you know optimal self custody experience so I think you know there's a lot of ample ground to be explored together I also think there's an opportunity for us to have a broader convert more inclusive conversation that.\
[2022-06-27T15:15:56.591Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin:  seems the web three.\
[2022-06-27T15:16:21.326Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	+q\
[2022-06-27T15:16:29.426Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: A lot of folks look at soulbound tokens as the only way for key holders in the ethereum ecosystem let's say to have non-transferable traits that can interact with on chain activities but I think that's just an issue of Education because for most people they're not aware of the other Primitives that are available that this group you know leads and is focused on the education space for implementing so the our common ground is vast I think you know.\
[2022-06-27T15:16:29.861Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin:  the difference is in our opinion are much smaller.\
[2022-06-27T15:16:57.314Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	q?\
[2022-06-27T15:17:00.879Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: Originally thought and so what we can welcome in this moment is a practical discussion of implementation how might we explore these ideas in a manner that preserves the well-being and optimizes for you know minimum rather minimizes harm for end-users helping them to address real challenges that they're facing today with tools that are going to make sense for them in the short term so you know while sold on tokens do not yet.\
[2022-06-27T15:17:34.727Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: Community College last Speck or are you know what that kind of guidance or interoperability across chains in the interim we might be able to explore some more practical implementations using the the specs that we already have but take into account these new ideas that that you know the people want to have non-transferable traits associated with their public addresses in aetherium that can be composable so that was a really fruitful discussion one that I'm really really glad that we had because now we can.\
[2022-06-27T15:17:35.223Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin:  see that you know at the end of the day we are all really you know human.\
[2022-06-27T15:17:40.824Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: Another trying to solve problems for human beings with these human coordination tools.\

[2022-06-27T15:20:27.019Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Has done really well is to give control back to the to the holder right and to me I can see there are some use cases wherein people want to put something public like for example in a LinkedIn profile High I put the fact that I study today see you but the main question I would have is a protocol involving sbts should first.\

[2022-06-27T15:20:58.642Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: The person who is actually receiving a credential because that would be my main concern that somebody had does not have a right to put anything about me in a public Ledger without my explicit permission so I see a workflow where in you know it's the classic you know issue ever holder interaction that is a presentation done I accept.\
[2022-06-27T15:20:58.867Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com:  out and then.\
[2022-06-27T15:21:29.735Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: This carried on and say posted as an SVT and as matter of fact the nfte could ideally point to a verifiable credential so that that document has some value as opposed to just some Json that is unsigned right so so there may be a use case right there but I would love to see the thoughts of this group on how that problem needs to be addressed thank you.\

[2022-06-27T15:22:04.836Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: I do and I absolutely would welcome you know notes from from others in this group as well I think that you touched on the crucial element here which is consent so to the extent that we can better enable individuals to decide the level of publicity and context of publicity of their personally identifiable information whether that is you know in this context and academic achievement I think that makes a ton of sense I think that the grand.\

That begs the question - is forcing a merger the right strategy? Is there some other approach?\

[2022-06-27T15:46:16.193Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: Many of the ideas in that D sock paper are trying to get at.\
[2022-06-27T15:46:19.134Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	How about chainlink verifying the VC and simply disclosing "Valid", can that work Jonny?\
[2022-06-27T15:46:23.969Z]	<Transcriber>	Kerri_Lemoie: Yeah that makes sense thanks explanation Johnny.\
[2022-06-27T15:47:06.669Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Yeah thank you Johnny for that explanation I was wondering would chain-link be able to do something like that in terms of just doing a verification and saying yes or no so that you don't I mean that can just kind of tries to minimize the amount of information that is disclosed but also allows the smart contract to say yes Mahesh has a valid thing so now let's move on to the next he can.\
[2022-06-27T15:47:07.823Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Give you the money or what.\
[2022-06-27T15:47:24.838Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: Right yeah I do think that that is the at least in my mind right now is the is the most appealing way to maybe solve this problem so you know.\
[2022-06-27T15:47:57.158Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: Right so thank you can publish a very minimized version of what it's almost a zkp right like you could even take it a little bit further and chain link you can prove something to chain link chain link is the trusted writer of some data to the chain about something and so they publish a some data on chain for that smart contract to read and in some way that only that contract knows how to read it I'm I mean it's a little.\
[2022-06-27T15:47:57.540Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny:  a bit gets a little bit in the weeds and I.\
[2022-06-27T15:48:30.691Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: I don't want to say anything that's you know technically incorrect here but I do think that that is at least right now the approach that I'm thinking about the most I don't know if it needs to be chain-link the one of the things that I'm really interested in is whether or not you can prove this without having to go through chain link so the user can be their own Oracle about this which would be interesting but there you know it might give you a level of abstraction you know kind of privacy heard privacy if you're going through.\

[2022-06-27T15:49:01.803Z]	<Transcriber>	Jonny: And putting that data on chain rather than the thing that is being proved on chain coming directly signed from your wallets public key and that might actually be beneficial if you go through a service like that for some extra layer of you know a buffer in terms of coral ability so yeah I think there's a lot of little nuances and things here that I think we're just now beginning to dig into.\
[2022-06-27T15:49:35.054Z]	<Transcriber>	Phil_T3: Sorry about that I've got a layer upon layer of your of audio issues yeah I would it sounds very much like to communities that have been architecting for different optimizations with the web three Community coming out of the original blockchain World and and its intention to be as transparent and.\

[2022-06-27T15:50:37.566Z]	<Transcriber>	Phil_T3: Their desires about privacy and such in the same way and at the same plane if you will as issuers and relying parties and so we have these two different philosophical approaches that are coming together and I'm wondering whether or not the goal isn't necessarily to merge these things but to find out where they do they intersect in a meaningful way and or is there a way to route.\

[2022-06-27T15:53:56.208Z]	<Transcriber>	Colin,_Learning_Economy: Overlap and intersections and also respecting some of the differences and the value that they might add because at the end of the day I think we at least my my view on some of this and I think many is here share the similar view is that we're trying to empower and enable individuals to have a level of ownership around their identity around their achievements around their assertions that is in many ways fundamentally different than the world that I grew up in and I'm imagining the world that many of you grew up in as well.\
[2022-06-27T15:53:56.774Z]	<Transcriber>	Colin,_Learning_Economy:  so I just wanted to jump in and say that I appreciate the conversation.\

[2022-06-27T15:54:14.051Z]	<Phil_T3>	My comments are in no way meant to suggest we should work together to explore opportunities for collaboration and perhaps there are ways to bridge the architectures.  It has a superificial analogy to parachains bridging different blockchain architectures.\

[2022-06-27T15:54:29.054Z]	<Transcriber>	Colin,_Learning_Economy: I really want to continue to read and learn and find some of those intersections and and would be definitely interested in you know architecting or contributing to the conversations around the architecture and the systems for both because I think they are they do have unique use cases for both and the VC world I've spent more time in the VC world and again I'm a I think a little bit of a guppy amongst the.\

[2022-06-27T15:56:34.916Z]	<Transcriber>	John_Kuo: Hey sweetie I was just you know listening very carefully to everything here and there's been this emphasis on you know preservation of pii and and privacy and control but you know one thing that VCS struggle with is to take types of credentials that you actually want to kind of broadcast publicly and you're not really that interested in maintaining privacy the intent of it is to show it off so a skill or a badge or things like that.\
[2022-06-27T15:57:04.390Z]	<Transcriber>	John_Kuo: You know you want to be able to make that public but there are some difficulties you know in doing that with respect to the very nature of what PCS are supposed to control so perhaps you know some collaboration with something like you know something on chain would be beneficial to making those types of BC's more accessible publicly.\

[2022-06-27T15:59:05.811Z]	<Transcriber>	Evin: And very man for leveraging and so in our research at disco we've seen explicitly the Dow Community is that do not want to have unfettered secondary markets or necessarily you know publicity around their membership wanting to take advantage of these getting.\

Ideally you can find a group of people who would want to work on this with you. Keep refining, reiterating. You might want to get other implementations involved, not required but help smooth the process to an official Standards track. Start getting as

CCG is all volunteers, we dont have formal resource support. A lot of this work has potential to become standards here or other places.
[2021-05-04T16:32:57.349Z]	<Kim>	note: there's a problem with the minute generation script, which you'll see in the 4/20 minutes email. I opened an issue, but I'll see if anything obvious in the github action logs stand out. I think other minutes have been fine
[2021-05-04T16:32:57.555Z]	<pete_M>	... Contrasted to a W3C Working Group. Only paid W3C members can be members of a working group. There are different formalities that come with that. This is a Standards Track type of work. Things can be reopened to possibly revise the product

[2021-05-04T16:33:44.938Z]	<Wayne_Chang>	congrats on your awesome chairing!
[2021-05-04T16:33:56.299Z]	<pete_M>	... We love to see the CCG group as a "big tent" to be able to work with different groups. We have active membership. We currently have a co-chair role open, looking to make adjustments for recruiting.
[2021-05-04T16:34:26.757Z]	<pete_M>	... Participation is really about the community. IIW recently showed us what the future might hold
[2021-05-04T16:34:41.059Z]	<pete_M>	mprorock: I can hop in here at slide #9
[2021-05-04T16:35:20.481Z]	<dmitriz>	question about the slides - is somebody supposed to be sharing a screen?
[2021-05-04T16:35:47.914Z]	<rgrant>	 https://drive.google.com/file/d/15BfjGKHEski3k1uFh88gNQcSYV0Laemx/view?usp=sharing
[2021-05-04T16:35:49.256Z]	<heathervescent>	Here are the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15BfjGKHEski3k1uFh88gNQcSYV0Laemx/edit#slide=id.gd34e0ce32d_0_1
[2021-05-04T16:36:31.193Z]	<pete_M>	... I wanted to start, since W3C is a standards body. Speaking to what that is. There are multiple outcomes to work here. From a w3C pov, we are looking at actual web standards. There are other bodies that look elsewhere. The standard itself is more in terms of the actual specs. Where standards are actually useful is external facing objects. Once you start repeating, and segmenting the groups, this is where
[2021-05-04T16:36:37.307Z]	<pete_M>	Standards become important.
[2021-05-04T16:37:02.679Z]	<heathervescent>	Thanks to Manu for creating this slide!
[2021-05-04T16:37:28.787Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	I think it's great that Mike's doing the background, btw
[2021-05-04T16:37:34.011Z]	<pete_M>	... Standards makes sure data is being exchanged in a normal way. Therefore, everyone understands whats going on. A lot of this stuff pre-dates me and my involvement here, but starts back at the beginning of DIDs and credentials.
[2021-05-04T16:37:49.670Z]	<heathervescent>	Thanks Manu - we are trying to circulate the knowledge through the community!
[2021-05-04T16:37:55.887Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	+1 to that!
[2021-05-04T16:39:55.924Z]	<pete_M>	... Link Data group is bringing important work. There is a lot of active discussions in the mailing list. These are the foundational parts of exchanging data. Everything is supported by the infrastructure task force, These are the calls, the minutes, and how we organize. There are the VC side, the DID side. Then there is the secure data storage group.
[2021-05-04T16:40:12.068Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	(and Kim - who made it accessible, and Heather for documenting it so others could use it, and Wayne for creating the ITF)... many hands :)
[2021-05-04T16:41:31.533Z]	<pete_M>	... Work item overview starts at the proposal. Proposing it in GitHub. Moving that in if there are no objections, then the item cycles through the processes. This is essentially a filtering process to get to that point. The CCG is involved in multiple levels DIDs and specs, and how to exchange those things. Lastly, the thing that goes in the VC
[2021-05-04T16:41:35.535Z]	<Wayne_Chang>	q?
[2021-05-04T16:43:04.885Z]	<heathervescent>	Thanks to Manu for this amazing timeline as well! And for spending time with the 101 team to tell us about all these items.
[2021-05-04T16:43:14.455Z]	<pete_M>	Fred: this slide is about a lot of the different work items the CCG has been involved with. There is the link portal, JSON-LD. In yellow, there are the vocab work items for the credentials/VCs. The pink is looking at moving the credentials around, resolution and CHAPI and so on. This timeline is the work items and specs done throughout the years so we can see how things are evolving throughout the ecosystem
[2021-05-04T16:43:40.700Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: Great, thank you. One of the topics we wanted to cover was
[2021-05-04T16:43:45.101Z]	<pete_M>	... what is SSI
[2021-05-04T16:44:05.140Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	"Governments hate it!" <-- hmm, not all governments :)
[2021-05-04T16:44:22.016Z]	<TallTed>	acronym for `Self Sovereign Identity`
[2021-05-04T16:44:37.059Z]	<pete_M>	... it is an approach to Digital Identity, but it is controversial. Since we love to discuss the deep-end we love this conversation. There can be different personal values on using the tech, but the tech can be used
[2021-05-04T16:44:54.784Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	#notAllGovernments
[2021-05-04T16:45:20.034Z]	<Kim>	hey, I don't like SSI either. And I'm not a government
[2021-05-04T16:45:45.597Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	The Government of Kimlandia.
[2021-05-04T16:45:51.537Z]	<dmitriz>	lol
[2021-05-04T16:46:05.310Z]	<pete_M>	Kim_Linson: this is for everyone who is brand-new. I had to do this myself. The formalities require you to make a W3C account. Validate it. Then you're in. There will be instructions on how to complete the process. This is the website here, this is important here.
[2021-05-04T16:47:11.915Z]	<pete_M>	... Lastly, on a level-one intro. Go ahead and join the mailing list. At the beginning it is a lot to read, but it really lets you understand the topic and the community. This will help you get comfortable to move further.
[2021-05-04T16:48:47.122Z]	<pete_M>	... Github, googledrive, meeting links, the minutes, the work item process. A few more things, I really like this slide. You do hear a lot of voices in these meetings, this is for newcomers. Linkedin profiles to see who these people are. Anil referenced Manu's youtube videos last week, thank you for those.
[2021-05-04T16:48:49.497Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Glad they helped... top artists worked on those videos. :P
[2021-05-04T16:49:03.259Z]	<kimhd>	Manu's json-ld videos helped me out a few years ago, they are great
[2021-05-04T16:49:18.258Z]	<mprorock>	pretty liberal with the term "excellent" there
[2021-05-04T16:49:24.521Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	huge thanks to Mprorock

[2021-05-04T16:50:37.433Z]	<pete_M>	... let me plug whats coming up. This afternoon we will do this presentation again. Last week Mike did a wonderful presentation, thank you. In june we will be doing an VC exchange for education. We want to do DIDs. Anyone coming to a 101, please think about how you can help someone who is brandnew understand these concepts. We 101 folks need that.
[2021-05-04T16:50:39.566Z]	<Jack_Tanner_(Gimly)>	very nice presentation!!!
[2021-05-04T16:50:57.244Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	That was great -- thank you to the CCG 101 folks for putting it together!

If anyone is working on work items and want help to translate it to a CCG 101 level presentation, the community will help you with that. We will start putting these presentations on the CCG youtube.

[2021-05-04T16:54:52.473Z]	<pete_M>	Caspar_Roelofs_(Gimly): thank you Heather, Kim. This group has been very welcoming. I have a question. if we want resources to train devs, or for a new dev in this space, if they wanted to learn about the SSI work and tech/specs. Where could we find the resources? Would you recommend resources? Are they collected somewhere?
[2021-05-04T16:55:01.623Z]	<heathervescent>	ack mprorock
[2021-05-04T16:55:04.718Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: please Mike, go ahead.
[2021-05-04T16:55:09.708Z]	<Kim>	if there ends up being a dev-to-dev onboarding, I'd be happy to help contribute what I know
[2021-05-04T16:55:13.235Z]	<heathervescent>	q?
[2021-05-04T16:55:55.865Z]	<pete_M>	mprorock: we have been looking into that. The tracability work has good recordings out there currently. I am happy to facilitate sessions for devs to help get their feet wet. Please reachout on the mailing list if you need somehting outside of the normal schedule

[2021-05-04T16:58:26.149Z]	<pete_M>	manu: I just wanted to start by saying thank you to the CCG 101 team, thank you heather for leading that, and thank yo uto those who put the presentation together. Id like to see this every few months or so to re-introduce the way we get things done here. The other thing, it breaks my heart hearing that people are intimidated sending emails to the mailing list. But I understand. I want to echo what Kim said:
[2021-05-04T16:58:32.253Z]	<pete_M>	we have a welcoming, inclusive group here. So, if there is anything we can do to make anything easier for anyone please let us know! Thats it
[2021-05-04T16:59:21.985Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	is a separate ccg101 mailing list an option?
[2021-05-04T16:59:36.362Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	+1 @Juan. Wondering the same
[2021-05-04T16:59:43.270Z]	<mprorock>	+1 juan - or a tag in the subject line
[2021-05-04T17:00:02.773Z]	<heathervescent>	q?
[2021-05-04T17:00:02.935Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: thank you Manu. Wayne, we might need to kick the IWW recap to next week. I understand being intimidated sending an email to the mailing list. This can allow us to explore different techniques on how to include newer community members. The people here who are regulars might be intimidating.
[2021-05-04T17:00:20.153Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	ooooh tag in subject line is a good idea
[2021-05-04T17:00:20.361Z]	<Wayne_Chang>	sure thing, happy to talk about it next week
[2021-05-04T17:00:39.707Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	huge applause all around! ccg101 is great work
[2021-05-04T17:00:49.039Z]	<pete_M>	... this looks like the end of the meeting. Thank you to everyone for coming today. Extra thanks to CCG 101, Kim, Fred, Mike. That concludes the meeting. Next time will be next week at this time

[2021-05-04T17:01:32.056Z]	<heathervescent>	All, I am kicking the remaining folks on the call to conclude the meeting. Thanks all.
[2021-05-04T17:01:39.312Z]	<heathervescent>	Thanks also to Pete for scribing again.

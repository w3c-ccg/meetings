[2024-11-11T16:02:57.506Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Thanks, Dmitri
[2024-11-11T16:03:10.924Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So as uh as you can see these meetings are recorded and it will be uh posted on uh the ccg minutes uh GitHub repository.
[2024-11-11T16:03:20.999Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right I think that's all the boilerplate let's get started uh any introductions or reintroductions uh aside from our August guests.
[2024-11-11T16:03:29.124Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh anyone new to the call that was introduced themselves or haven't introduced in a while and want to reintroduce.
[2024-11-11T16:03:35.923Z]	<Transcriber>	Merul_(AuvoDigital): Hi I'm it's it's my first time in this call I'm mol I'm the CTO and co-founder for alvo digital.
[2024-11-11T16:03:45.916Z]	<Transcriber>	Merul_(AuvoDigital): Uh I've been in the identity space for about uh 4 years now I'm I you guys might know me from tangle labs.
[2024-11-11T16:03:54.912Z]	<Transcriber>	Merul_(AuvoDigital): I've been a mentor for Google summer of code and have had background working with Google and a couple corporate players.

[2024-11-11T16:04:18.332Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right uh any Community announcements events coming up and so.
[2024-11-11T16:04:34.081Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: On all right no announcements let's jump into it so our main topic today is Gan uh is the global acceptance Network and we have drum and Reed.
[2024-11-11T16:04:41.581Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh and and team to uh come talk to us about it uh Drummond over to you.
[2024-11-11T16:04:49.907Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh you bet happen to be here and actually um uh accompany me is Andor kesselman who's uh.

[2024-11-11T16:05:05.425Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: On our Tech Team and so uh we'll start out by doing brief introductions um so uh I've been I've been in the uh um internet identity space uh since they started internet identity Workshop uh.
[2024-11-11T16:05:05.617Z]	<andor>	David Poltorak is here as well. Also leading the tech workstream
[2024-11-11T16:05:14.410Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: 19 years ago I guess it's going to be 20 with the next 1 uh and and uh last week was uh.
[2024-11-11T16:05:33.017Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Quite amazing with 355 people at IBEW um the largest 1 ever first time we ever uh actually maxed out on the second day we ran out of rooms for all the sessions that were called so um uh but I've been to all of them and been on the whole you know um.
[2024-11-11T16:06:09.113Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh SSI decentralized identity train and uh so very happy to be here uh uh today to talk to you about uh another step in that direction the global acceptance Network um I mostly work uh and have been working on the standards and protocols in the space for a long time was 1 of the co-authors of the uh decentralized identity um specification w3c and worked on um the first version of a verifiable credentials not so much the second version that's that's um been a another great group uh Ander over to you to do a little introduction.
[2024-11-11T16:06:13.222Z]	<Deb>	present+
[2024-11-11T16:06:32.186Z]	<Transcriber>	andor: Yep and also we have David as well who also is helping lead the uh the tech workstream uh my name is Andor um I am leading the tech workstream alongside with uh Dave Pak who's joining this call as well um previously have uh done a number of of startups and so forth as a CTO and also very active in the diff and Trust of communities in various capacities.
[2024-11-11T16:06:34.575Z]	<James_Chartrand>	present+
[2024-11-11T16:06:49.717Z]	<Transcriber>	andor: Um mostly was focused on personal data source prior to this um and then has been had had I've had the pleasure of working with Drummond and a few other folks on the Gan or these last 6 months so it's been a fantastic journey and um Dave you're up next.
[2024-11-11T16:07:19.994Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Cool excellent um.
[2024-11-11T16:07:23.454Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: So uh we're um.
[2024-11-11T16:08:24.575Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: We're here to talk to you today about the global acceptance Network give you some background and and hopefully uh uh dive into um you know 1 of the main topics that uh the Gan uh we we do use that uh uh acronym for for short um that again is focused on which is interoperable uh trust Registries uh for digital trust ecosystems um and uh I want to say uh uh Demetri uh invited us to uh to join this after he gave a fantastic session on uh um trust Registries at at IBEW and uh we we agreed hey we we have a lot a lot in common a lot to talk about so I'm hoping um this uh ends up being very interactive we we'll describe what we're doing uh at the well acceptance Network why we set it up where we're going and then we just love for it to be as interactive as we can to discuss um you know what.
[2024-11-11T16:08:25.402Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed:  what your needs are.
[2024-11-11T16:08:33.191Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh educ working group and and where you uh see yourselves going with trust registries.
[2024-11-11T16:08:38.135Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Will quickly share my screen to uh.
[2024-11-11T16:08:40.658Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: See I want to pick up.
[2024-11-11T16:08:43.142Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: This window right here.
[2024-11-11T16:08:48.158Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: And uh tell me if that's showing their.
[2024-11-11T16:08:53.172Z]	<Colin_Reynolds,_Ed_Design_Lab>	present+
[2024-11-11T16:08:55.228Z]	<Transcriber>	andor: Hey Sean d.
[2024-11-11T16:08:55.562Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yep we can see it go ahead.
[2024-11-11T16:08:59.373Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Good okay that just uh you know quickly um.
[2024-11-11T16:09:29.982Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Summarize that uh at a high level so uh we'll dive down into it but the the whole concept of digital trust ecosystems is uh at the at the heart of what we're doing with the global acceptance Network um and uh what we uh realized uh a number of us working in this space um is that as the uh adoption of verifiable digital credentials uh grows and digital wallets grow.
[2024-11-11T16:09:43.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Going to face the situation is similar to what uh payment cards did um you know 40 50 years ago uh which is you know interoperability across the different um.
[2024-11-11T16:09:50.209Z]	<Jeff_O_-_HumanOS>	present+
[2024-11-11T16:09:54.849Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh networks and ecosystems that they started to be adopted in and you know for the very same reasons the maximum value is credentials that.
[2024-11-11T16:09:55.162Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed:  for some.
[2024-11-11T16:10:14.387Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Credentials I put it anyway it can be uh accepted across ecosystems um and and to do that of course you need to have a way of of of verifying um those credentials and that's the uh the key role of of trust Registries and we'll get into.
[2024-11-11T16:10:23.863Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh doing that in a way that is uh secure interoperable safe and sustainable um across you know what we hope become.
[2024-11-11T16:10:42.398Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Thousands and eventually tens of thousands and millions of digital trust ecosystems is uh is is the problem space where we said we're headed into this the earlier we tackle it um the the better off we'll all be uh Having learned the lessons of you know things like the payment Networks.
[2024-11-11T16:11:15.724Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: But also seeing how um with decentralized identity and trust it they're fundamental differences in the design we're not going to put together a centralized system like uh these are Mastercard or Amex uh needs to be decentralized and and that requires uh um you know uh working together on uh what will the the governance interoperability um and uh uh adoption of of those ecosystems so um.
[2024-11-11T16:11:35.155Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: I'll give you a little context uh on on how uh we got here um my uh day job is uh director Trust Services at Jen uh we're 1 of the uh we're formed by the merger of a vast Norton LifeLock to the largest antivirus and consumer cyber safety companies.
[2024-11-11T16:12:04.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: And uh um I work in the division called digital Trust Services uh which was started at a vast originally recognizing that the whole next generation of consumer cyber safety tools uh needed to tackle uh things like digital credentials digital wallets digital Trust Services and uh so um the whole world of of SSI and and verifiable credentials uh it's been moving into that space pretty quickly.
[2024-11-11T16:12:33.188Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: As we talked to some of our customers about the world we're doing in that area uh they they very much resonate with uh the concept of digital trust ecosystems and uh I'm going to take a second I'm going to pop over here and uh to um a diagram uh from 1 of the white papers that we've been working on with our members are is this I I want to make sure the the screen changed are you seeing this now the uh.
[2024-11-11T16:12:37.800Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yep uh we can can see the whole the the 3.
[2024-11-11T16:12:47.553Z]	<Kaliya_IdentityWoman>	present+
[2024-11-11T16:12:57.880Z]	<andor>	https://gan.foundation/
[2024-11-11T16:13:28.061Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Good good good exactly so I'm gonna I'll make it a little bit larger here but I'm gonna point out uh the name of this uh paper that we're working on that I hope will be released on the uh on the Gan dot Foundation by the way is the uh the website that we um um um brought up in in in uh September to start talking publicly about the global acceptance Network I hope this white paper will be up it's in the second round of review by uh by our members right now but I'll highlight the title the ecosystem of ecosystems model for decentralized digital trust infrastructure um that is you know we we've been working on this white paper because it explains the essence of what we're doing with the Gan and and I'm going to share a few diagrams from this paper just to make it as crystal clear as I can what it is we're doing and why.
[2024-11-11T16:13:54.264Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Um so you know I think everyone on this call is probably very familiar with this uh diagram uh the upper half of which we've referred to as the trust triangle for a long time and then when you uh add the governing body at the bottom for uh for scalability and uh various other reasons um interoperability then you get uh the trust diamond or governance Diamond whichever 1 you want to call it.
[2024-11-11T16:14:21.282Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: And um when it comes to the exchange of verifiable credentials uh this I call this the core DNA of uh decentralized digital trust um I have another version of this diagram that puts a I want to call credential family right in the center because that's what every digital trust ecosystem ends out revolving around is what is what is the credential or family of credentials that they need.
[2024-11-11T16:15:22.039Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh meet the trust objectives of that ecosystem um and then of course uh the governing body which may be as formal as a you know nation state government or as informal as a you know open source Community um or um a church a school even a a neighborhood uh whatever um uh governance they are are using for that uh ecosystem for that family of credentials uh public and what we generally call governance framework many folks in the uh industry uh in the identities we call Trust Frameworks the point is it's at least human readable and it may also be all or portions of it um uh machine readable uh but that those are the policies that anyone inside or outside the ecosystem can look at and to which the members of the ecosystem are either formally or informally uh making.
[2024-11-11T16:15:23.075Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Ments that they're.
[2024-11-11T16:15:53.840Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Operating by those policies and again there's a whole Spectrum um of you know informal very lightly weight uh trust Community operating like an open source project at the other end of the spectrum you have something like the European digital identity wallets initiative where um there's very deep um uh government regulation uh you know 27 member states working together to develop their own um digital wallet implementation their own legislation around it.
[2024-11-11T16:15:57.714Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: And then of course the interoperability that need to achieve.
[2024-11-11T16:16:00.207Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Um and since I mentioned that.
[2024-11-11T16:16:16.755Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: Uh the Udi uh uh project I want to point out it is a wonderful example um of uh what we call the ecosystem of ecosystems model because you as you're looking at a digital trust ecosystem again as smaller as large as it might be.
[2024-11-11T16:16:36.251Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: It becomes pretty clear oh well there's there's there's many cases where you're going to have governance uh that's Set uh for a number of ecosystems that operate within a larger ecosystem um and the eugi is a good example um they're setting uh uh uh.
[2024-11-11T16:17:04.804Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: And and interoperability requirements for the EU as a whole but they're 27 member states and uh uh Jen is 1 of the companies participating in the large-scale pilots for the EU di wallet and we just uh finished presenting report that basically points out well guess what the EU um digital identity Wallace ecosystem is an ecosystem of ecosystems it probably goes at least 3 levels and in some cases deeper than that.
[2024-11-11T16:17:28.300Z]	<Transcriber>	Drummond_Reed: We believe this ecosystem of ecosystems pattern whether it's National or jurisdictional based ecosystems or industry based ecosystems um or more specialized ecosystems it'll be a common pattern to see ecosystem of ecosystems uh and that's why um the interoperability between ecosystems become so important.

[2024-11-11T16:43:12.931Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Do I interpret correctly that it is then possible that a credential issuer (e.g. university) is authorised to issue certain types of credentials in ecosystem X but not in ecosystem Y?
[2024-11-11T16:43:29.572Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	@Ildiko - I believe so, yes
[2024-11-11T16:43:51.791Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	:+1: Makes sense, thanks Dmitri
[2024-11-11T16:44:21.036Z]	<andor>	yes. Ecosystems are sovereign and manage their own authorization layers. So Ecosystem X may authorize differently than Ecosystem Y a particular entity.
[2024-11-11T16:44:53.488Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Thanks for the reassurance, Andor

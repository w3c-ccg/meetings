[2021-09-21T20:18:02.976Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	... and we should use change request feature in github to be very clear and direct

[2021-09-21T20:19:17.925Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	jandrieu: I think we should remind ourselves we're in INCUBATION MODE and other processes in incubation mode work in google docs and very quickly
[2021-09-21T20:19:33.086Z]	<brent>	I think 7 days is fine, especially in view of the desired iterative process.
[2021-09-21T20:19:34.201Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	... so we shouldn't let the GH format put us into a very deliberative process autopilot
[2021-09-21T20:20:00.359Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	Manu: I sympathize with both sides of this, we can't be too cautious but there are reasons to be cautious even though we're at such an early stage

[2021-09-21T20:36:22.379Z]	<Orie>	Justin is correct
[2021-09-21T20:36:26.539Z]	<Orie>	we can't merge a draft.
[2021-09-21T20:36:33.882Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	draft status is fine
[2021-09-21T20:36:40.546Z]	<Justin_Richer>	I marked it draft so it wouldn't be merged, it would be discussed.
[2021-09-21T20:36:52.572Z]	<Orie>	draft is fine, I won't approve it until it is mergeable and feedback is addressed.
[2021-09-21T20:37:04.202Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	manu: a label would be technically redundant but help scanning a long list of PRs
[2021-09-21T20:37:10.169Z]	<Justin_Richer>	I suggest "draft" because it has mechanical enforcement
[2021-09-21T20:37:21.956Z]	<Orie>	^ i think Justin did the right thin.

[2021-09-21T20:41:13.558Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	Justin: I'm not a fan of "do not merge" because it can be used passive-aggressively
[2021-09-21T20:41:16.705Z]	<brent>	on github repos where I have proper access I can convert any PR to draft.

[2021-09-21T20:41:36.696Z]	<TallTed>	draft theoretically means that its author doesn't think it's ready for others to review, it exits draft for others to review, and *then* the merge question comes up.
[2021-09-21T20:42:07.953Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	Orie: These descriptive labels are kind of orthogonal to the behavior we're expecting in the code owners
[2021-09-21T20:43:05.434Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	... i think we need to remember the editors have power and responsibility
[2021-09-21T20:43:10.639Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	Manu: No op and move on?

[2021-09-21T20:47:26.519Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	Justin_Richer: Here is an editorial hackjob that takes the letter of my comment and not the spirit. I do not like this PR
[2021-09-21T20:47:26.775Z]	<TallTed>	Multiple open change requests ... and says it's a partial substitute for #226, which also remains open, so what's the actual choice to be made?

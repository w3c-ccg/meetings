<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Intersect because I know we leverage that with some of the interoperability testing at uh us CBP uh that recently uh went out and um I think I could put a link to a press release that just went out today kind of talking about some of that work but if you want more details obviously you could talk to me you can also talk to my mood right because they drove the oil gas pipeline um stuff that is now going into. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Uh it will started to go into limited production right so we&apos;re seeing some really cool stuff on the global trade side uh happening live so uh so just kind of in that context we&apos;re now seeing literally years of work kind of coalescing into what sort of boring right behind the scenes movement from system to System of different stuff but it enables solving some real world business problems. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  So the uh you&apos;ll probably note that the uh November date on this um uh presentation uh this is because this is uh some stuff that I did uh uh is effectively. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Um a talk that I gave at NYU and Microsoft research around ethical Computing but uh um and and I think it had kind of really intersects with what we&apos;re doing here so just just kind of context for us right as trade verified what we&apos;re doing is basically going through and leveraging information to go it will point out and identify supply chain risks before they actually become an issue um. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  That that&apos;s the business problem right that&apos;s the business context and really the tech um I won&apos;t say it&apos;s irrelevant right but if you&apos;re not solving a business problem that people are motivated on we won&apos;t get adoption right so we&apos;ve been able to uh leverage a lot of standards in advancing the solution of some of these broader business problems and specifically what triggered a lot of the adoption in uh. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Uh that we&apos;re seeing in trade on our side I actually has to do with uh a piece of legislation in the that started in the US that now has got equivalence rolling out in Canada and EU and Australia and others but uh basically that holds importers accountable. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  For use of forced labor in the products right and and basically says look if if if we think that forced labor was used anywhere in the creation of a product. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Um that uh we we can hold that uh container right they can hold those products and keep them from getting to Market and that that&apos;s a big change right that&apos;s a that&apos;s a clear regulatory thing with monetary impact but it&apos;s in response to a very serious real world issue and when we think about showing that you&apos;re not using forced labor right in your products what&apos;s interesting about that is that gives you that ability uh it it puts it a domain right on the Importer or someone involved in the trade workflow to provide visibility right to go through and actually uh give trans transparent accounting um of what&apos;s involved in the production of the product and there&apos;s a lot of pieces in that depending on what it is right you can imagine we see some very complicated Supply chains uh especially in like electronics and automotive and things like that where you may be live looking at pieces you know all the way back. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  It&apos;s a pretty wild amount of stuff to think about right from a graph standpoint. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  So when we think about going through and using good visibility and trade um there&apos;s a couple of key premises that I that I think are important right the and the first is that trust right if we&apos;re going to believe or build a belief network of some kind. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Um you know certain things about the trade data flow uh and the data related to supply chains uh that that has to be built up over time and so if we&apos;re going to build that up over time that means we need to things we need yes visibility as to what&apos;s happening where and where in the world and what steps are happening Etc but we also need distinct attribution um and and and what we mean by that is we need to know who is presenting the data right. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:   You know. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  And that that&apos;s just really a hard requirement there and as something I want to call out for this audience especially because I know a lot of times we look at um. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Uh personal credentials right or you know whether that&apos;s a driver&apos;s license right or a passport or some permanent resident card right there&apos;s been all sorts of neat stuff that&apos;s spun out of this group and folks like Manu and others that have been working in the space for a long time but a lot of times those concerns and cases are really focused on things that are touching on the individual right which means that any kind of personally identifying information you know pii uh or things uh. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  You know related to you know information that should be preserved uh in a privacy preserving manner right this should be under the control of an individual right um. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  That&apos;s a got a competing interests with what we see a lot of times in the business and Regulatory world right so when we think about personal credentials things like unlink is really really important right things like having that ability to uh selectively disclose right without leaking information right um you know that you&apos;re above age for something right or have a certain license in place or have a certain citizenship right those those kinds of things that you want to be able to just reveal the minimal amount of information without revealing other data you know like when you were born exactly or where you live or who you&apos;re connected to right those are those kinds of things that need to be preserved there but trade and in particular cross-border trade and international regulatory stuff and business stuff that actually has the opposite requirement right we must know who people are we must know and we must have required links between. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:   The identity. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Being exchanged um and we must have clear attribution of who is saying 1 right and what they&apos;re claiming um and that&apos;s both for regulatory purposes but it&apos;s also um a hard requirement if we&apos;re going to go through. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Uh and to start to root out or identify where an issue exists right whether that&apos;s a forced labor issue like I kind of started talking about or other issues right hey maybe we had a uh. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Um you know sanctions violation or maybe we had some tainted materials right we did it just read some testing with FDA and USDA Aus and others like you know let&apos;s look at like disease spread um or something coming into the supply chain that way so there are real world things that really require that ability to say who is connected to who and what made up this product and where did it come from and how did it move through the supply chain. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  When we look at the business side though there are strong requirements around privacy and these are the things that people get sensitive around right um in the business context and this is an area that I think we&apos;re starting to see some good answers around we&apos;re we&apos;re definitely I think there&apos;s good work on SD JWT I think is getting ready to go to last call we&apos;ll find out um sdcwa cases uh and obviously also uh variety of the select disclosure mechanisms we see out of the pure um kind of linked data world as well um that&apos;s how we account for some of these things um that are uh concerning and require privacy or sensitivity um of handling in the business World which is basically the falling into typically 3 buckets pricing information is super sensitive right someone Upstream. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  In the supply chain doesn&apos;t want to go reveal a price advantage that they&apos;re giving to 1 you know 1 P person purchasing can have for uh versus another. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-202').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-202').show()" id="202" class="comment"><span class="name">Mike Prorock</span>:  Uh so that binding right of the key material back into the actual signed document that can be resolved by a third party openly right that&apos;s 1 of the things that uh I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen a good answer to because it&apos;s got to work with x509 and the existing infrastructure we have right even if we&apos;re looking at some of that in Kos as opposed to just text um sorry sorry any ietf folks that uh like the existing way we handle domains the next 509 but I hate it um but uh you know but that stuff that infrastructure is not going away and we shouldn&apos;t expect it to or expect to ever have any realistic chance of replacing it right so we&apos;re going to have to link to that somehow so. <a id="link-202" style="display:none;" href="#202">✪</a></div>

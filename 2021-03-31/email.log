Wayne_Chang: Topic: Introductions & Reintroductions
Peter Mackinnon: Hi, Pete -- I'm new here -- a student, here to learn about this exciting new ecosystem. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Peter Mackinnon: Excited to learn, im a student, lets have fun
Wayne_Chang: any reintroductions?
Wayne_Chang: Topic: Announcements & Reminders
https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action%3A+review+next%22
... moving to progress on action items
Heather Vescent: Next week we are moving back to the old time Tues 9AM pacific
Manu Sporny: Announcement about DID core change if we have time
Wayne_Chang: action item review, is gimly_jack here? Anyone else can speak up
Juan Caballero: Minutes are on github, link will be posted. This is a multi signature item
Wayne_Chang: next items, CHAPI Interop
... it meets criteria
... SOLID's parallels with CCG, and next steps for both ecosystems
Manu Sporny: Spoke with Sarven, spoke about potential overlaps
Sarven Capadisli: Intro -- working on SOLID for 5+ years
... committee group chair, busy working on tech specs and tech reports for SOLID
Manu Sporny: Sarven's been around the the CG's for a while, great to have you here
... ill go down the list, summarizing overlap
... starting at the most basic layer moving upwards
... solid is working on things that we're not but need, lots of mutual benefit
... SOLID supports JSON-LD, which the CCG depends on quite a bit
... JSON-LD is a global standard (v1.1), we are all using it
... SOLID uses other stuff than JSON-LD. Any thoughts on JSON-LD Sarven?
Sarven Capadisli: Its in the RDF family, i think its a thing that both groups agree on and work with
Manu Sporny: SOLID uses stuff other than JSON-LD, maybe you could speak a bit to that?
Sarven Capadisli: Fundamentally RDF 1.1 concepts we try to adhere to, min. requirements for SOLID servers to provide a representation for resources are JSON-LD and Turtle
... content negotiation is open and on the table, thats possible if applications want to ask for it, thats it on the RDF end
... SOLID servers are just generic HTTP servers with some understandings of linking, and JSON-LD happens to be one of the items we've got
... just a note here, one reason we chose JSON-LD, it can conform with some other specs out of the box
Manu Sporny: That basically means, everything that this community is doing, SOLID pods can understand it at a very low level
... this is an example of what we're working on but SOLID isn't, but could use and build off of
... data models like: VC specs, extensions to specs. (Status List, Auto Refresh), crypto stuff, SOLID can consume the VC's work from CCG
... I think there's an expectation here that this community keeps working on the VC stuff, and the SOLID community is already/will use this work item coming up for the SOLID community
... so thats a great example of something we're working on that is useful in the SOLID ecosystem
... VC discussion: how to move things I/O of solid pods, or for our community: digital wallets. You can think of a Solid pods as a digital wallet, or a part of a digital wallet
... Then the question is "how to get data I/O from Solid pods?" and CCG has some very specific protocols on how to do this, SOLID has general protocols for using a Solid Pod
... both groups have a general awareness for data containers I/O
... maybe Solid pod supports the credential handler API, or a Solid applicaiton might do that. Thoughts Sarven?
<tallted> Digital Wallet has a fair number of requirements that I would not nnecessarily expect to be part of a Solid Pod.
<tallted> Solid Pods are much more of a general storage space
Sarven Capadisli: I dont see major conflicts
... parts of the group depends on implementation
... CHAPI and some of the other specs are not representing what is, or where it's implemented
... we need to see if things will be optional, best-practices, etc
... SOLID is working to see what's missing on our end, and what might work to remedy
Wayne_Chang: question about SOLID pod, where can we find info?
<tallted> A Digital Wallet *app* might target a Solid Pod as its storage space.
Sarven Capadisli: Its the main protocol spec, an extension of the HTTP server, RFC 7230 and 7231 for more details
... inteded to be compatible with LDP
... HTTP server with some linking understanding in a nutshell
Manu Sporny: https://solid.github.io/specification/
Wayne_Chang: manu, credential handler API question. is there a way to go forward with CHAPI support if the browser API doesn't support the credential handling?
Sarven Capadisli: Please refer to https://solidproject.org/TR/ for TR index.. and for Protocol: https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol
Manu Sporny: Excellent question. CHAPI is currently a poly-fill (things you want to have eventually existing in the browser but dont yet)
... getting browser vendors to adopt technology is a sensitive situation. Vendors want to see a broad ecosystem before they adopt it
... CHAPI never needs to be built into the browser, so the ecosystem can exist if vendors dont support it
... but ideally it is built into the browser, its an upgrade
Dmitri Zagidulin: (Though it certainly will be great when it is :) )
Sarven Capadisli: From SOLID, we dont need to wait for browser adoption if we adopt CHAPI
... if it happens, great, but not a concern for now
Manu Sporny: Moving on to other items, Decentralized Identifierss, built on DLTs and Blockchains
... correct me if I'm wrong: SOLID is very much built on the web, has its own DID method built on top of DID web
... the question is if SOLID will support more DID methods in the future, what are your thoughts sarven
Sarven Capadisli: The DID is new-ish to SOLID, its a way for connecting different environments
... we're looking into DIDkey, for example, to see how its being implemented, DIDs that are blockchaining on the end are a bit further away
... DIDweb and DIDSolid is a jumping point for a DID environment to talk about later
Sarven Capadisli: https://solid.github.io/did-method-solid/
Wayne_Chang: thats a good opportunity to hear about DID Solid
Sarven Capadisli: Its a work in progress with Amy Guy and Dimitri Zadidulin
... DID web was too generalized/under-specified for SOLID
... if it works against a SOLID server, it will work with HTTP servers
... DIDSolid specifies the CRUD, more than the DID web, which is only "read" right now
Wayne_Chang: are you saying SOLID will specify how you update or delete items?
Sarven Capadisli: DID Web doesnt specify how you update/delete, could work with HTTP/FTP servers
... DID Solid is on the other end, closer to HTTP
Heather Vescent: I was curious about general feedback from others
... practically, how can we work together CCG/SOLID?
Manu Sporny: https://solid.github.io/did-method-solid/
Sarven Capadisli: Some are looking for clarificaitons on specs and if SOLID can assist with them
... and compared to CCG we are smaller group
... I'm hoping people who are interested in VCs begin reading the specs and seeing overlap, starting to implement CCG work, providing more feedback to CCG
... for specifications: we should notice any conflicts between the group's trajectory/focus, and how to coordinate better
... bringing people together is starting to happen, I welcome more advice on what to do going forward
Phil L.: I think this group is interested in SOLID as a repository for credentials in general
... id like to see an overview of the VC model and how presentations would work with SOLID, what are the things SOLID might need to build out?
Sarven Capadisli: Hard to respond, working on encryption is really important, its an area that we are not covering. Dimitri might chime in here, but to what extent that overlaps with a SOLID pod would be good information.
Manu Sporny: "Is there anything that conflicts" is a really good question
... we dont want to make things more complicated, or duplicate effort for any community
... authorization capability / web access control stuff, I dont think they're in conflict, there are two ways to do different things
... these are discussions that will take place naturally between communities
... like sarven said, we cant really discuss until people start using the mechanisms
... I'm not so concerned about web access control/ zcap, but more about wallets/hubs/SOLID protocol stuff, because both groups are working on similar issues in their own corners
... SOLID has a bunch of higher-level concepts which is really useful for a wallet, but unsure if it will be used at the moment
... Potential conflict might be higher up on the stack and this is where i think we will see very interesting discussions in the future
<phil.l> Is it fair to say that Solid then isn't an initial target for credential storage for VCs, e.g., as a wallet credential store?
Sarven Capadisli: Eg. https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/121
Charles E. Lehner: https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries/pull/276 ← Conflict
Heather Vescent: A way to break the ice for the two groups is have a hackathon
... have a great way to work together on the same issues
... looking for a fun way to focus and enjoy time spent working together
... i love reading specs, but thinking of something different
Heather Vescent: Hackathon/barcamp/Q&A sessions would be great [scribe assist by Sarven Capadisli]
<by_caballero> IIW?
<csarven> YES!!! +1 heathervescent
Sarven Capadisli: PROPOSAL accepted :P
Manu Sporny: +1 To being able to loosely coordinate
Juan Caballero: https://internetidentityworkshop.com/
Manu Sporny: A +1 to the IIW/Barcamp idea from heathervescent
... sarven it might be good to look at overlap/workitems
... moving on -- protecting data/ VCs
... HTTP signatures might have overlap with SOLID, they have web access control stuff
... CCG uses them for EDV and Zcaps, these are common connections making different products between CCG/SOLID
... encrypted data vaults should be built in a way where the user knows their data is secure
... you and the people you've authorized are the only ones able to view the data
... EDVs are a potential for SOLID
<dmitriz> (Henry is investigating using HTTP Sigs for user authentication (which it's not really for))
Sarven Capadisli: Generally, what CCG has some very useful items for the SOLID group
... if we are not using something now, we are still studying it, getting towards usage
... im excited to see how we can adopt what CCG has to offer, less worried about conflicts, just working towards complete understanding on the specs
Manu Sporny: A specification we have been working on is in the next phase towards adoption
... DIDs are one of those standards, "a better type of identifier for you/businesses"
... provides security and confidence with next-get cryptography
... DIDs started in 2014, worked on it within CCG for a long time before proposing it to the membership group
... launched DID working group in 2019
... starting mid 2019, working group has been on this untill just recently
... we are currently in the cadidate recommendation phase, hopefully done by April/May
... we are testing non-stop, if all good we move onto a proposed recommendation phase
... that means we are "done" and it then moves to an official vote
... hopefully done around September 30th, back to you Wayne
<heathervescent> WooT! Congrats!
Wayne_Chang: thank you everyone for joining the call, things are looking good and progressing well

Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right now it's on uh so as always calls 
  are recorded uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You got to be a member of the group to 
  contribute to Specs uh though these calls are open to anyone uh 
  we're under w3c code of conduct uh yeah let's uh let's get 
  started is anybody new here that want to introduce themselves.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And if not are there any Community 
  announcements.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Fortunately I think not too much is going on 
  in the space right now pretty holidays everybody's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's right that's right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah yeah it's it's very pleasant although I 
  do know of a couple of education related teams that are like oh 
  no we gotta we gotta do something by the end of December either 
  to spend the budget or to ship something so I I know some people 
  Are Burning Midnight Oil.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But hopefully it's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Nobody here okay so uh in that case no 
  announcements uh no introductions let's move on to our main 
  agenda which is hey do.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of questions discussion topics or just tell us 
  what you're working on uh we're always interested in if you're 
  working on a pilot or uh documentation issuing verifying whatever 
  vaguely related to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Potentials and or education uh please feel 
  free to raise your hand hop on a queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh especially like the share a sample 
  credential part that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's a really good.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah great question uh it'll be you know up on 
  the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah that's a really good point I think a lot 
  of people especially uh teams that are starting on something 
  would love to see that I think 2 such a repository I would say is 
  the is the diff uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Credential schema here I'll I'll throw a link 
  but you you know what I'm talking about it's that spec where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where Kim uh and and the dip team are 
  collecting uh various examples.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wonder if we can make it even easier for 
  people to share by just we can Kickstart just a Google doc that 
  say Hey you know just paste yours right below alright so that you 
  don't have to make up all requests to to to the repo or anything 
  like that just like informally based something here I think that 
  would be an amazing start.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh yeah so let me find.
<ildiko_mazar> I would be very happy to share some of our creds
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Anybody does anybody else know uh Sam 
  repositories of samples of uh verify the credentials for people 
  to look at.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah credential schema standards.
Dmitri Zagidulin: https://identity.foundation/credential-schemas/
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah and I think if like just like us here has 
  uh here here it is in jitsu.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Driven by the exact same.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Um motivations as as what we just mentioned uh 
  wants to start getting more schemes as well but yeah let's let's 
  just kick kick off a um a Google doc we can share it to the VC 
  Edge.
<ildiko_mazar> :+1:
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Drive and and and pass it around here and on 
  the mailing list because I think it would be interesting we got a 
  little bit of that effect by the way um last year at the jmf plug 
  vests so that would probably be the closest thing we have to 
  sample credentials that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A bunch of implementers issuers verifiers and 
  wallets interoperate with uh but those were yeah uh Simon go 
  ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Agreed yeah so hey let's let's do this uh 
  2-tiered mechanism we'll start up a Google doc for anybody to 
  paste and comment and then of the of the ones that are a bit more 
  formalized we can uh pass them over to the div credential schema 
  Repository.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Back uh for those of you uh who who are just 
  joining us we were talking about whether there's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh if there's any example credential 
  repositories that we know of uh that.
<ildiko_mazar> Great! Thanks. We can tag these examples as well 
  if that would be helpful
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For for us to look at because the first thing 
  at least I asked whenever talking to somebody who consider 
  implementing credentials or is in the process of a pilot is hey 
  can you send us a copy of your of the raw Json of the data model 
  that you're using right so we can judge where whether how heavy 
  of a lift it would be to make our software compatible with it and 
  so on so I think I think everybody wants it nobody doesn't want 
  it so let's just make it happen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah and so I I totally agree with uh with 
  Simone that we we we of course want to get a sense for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Test sandbox credentials and ones in 
  production.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Although I do want to to caution that uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Even that is not indicative of a standard set 
  in stone because even in production it's still schemas are 
  evolving teams are learning right so for example um 1 1 of the 
  universities in the Consortium I think it was McMasters 
  University uh started issuing diploma credentials I think even as 
  early as like 2 years ago right so it's in production but I 
  wouldn't say that yes that's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   That's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I know I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Could use it right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They've learned a lot from it it was a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It was best guesses at the time so we want to 
  make sure to not set schemas and cement but of course.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We also want to be interoperable it's it's the 
  usual Razor's Edge that we try to walk.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In standards land.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right anyone else uh is there any other 
  questions.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Challenges that your teams are running into or 
  topic discussions.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What are we going to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To deal with International.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And just to answer my own question oh hey you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah agreed I didn't real developer usability.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Explain me how easy it is is it for developers 
  to understand the data model and to come up with variations of it 
  that that's that's huge of course.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And I think we all know that uh both in the 
  area of credentials in general and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In specific those are not the easiest specs in 
  examples to understand which is why we want many many examples 
  for developers to look at.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah absolutely and and the other thing we we 
  see a lot because so we hear this question a lot like uh okay 
  we're interested in testing out verifiable credential what should 
  we start with transcript diploma student ID or course credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I always recommend you should probably start 
  with whatever the lightest lift probably a course credential 
  because for an issuer to sign off on a schema for a transcript 
  that imagine how many.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   How many.
<ildiko_mazar> Same in Europe, Dmitri
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Stakeholders at least here in the US right how 
  many stakeholders it's uh it involves like the registar the 
  lawyers uh like it's a it's a primary export of a university and 
  so everybody cares about it whereas if you just like pick up 
  professor and pick a a course to try on and say yeah just just do 
  that there's much less sign off it's it's not the full University 
  behind it it's it's something you can try yeah good mentions and 
  chat that same deal in your yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I didn't want.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I briefly going back to internationalization 
  so uh so so we've got a situation where we have at least 3 
  different.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Multi language credential uh uh mechanisms in 
  use.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh only 1 of which is supported by open badges 
  version 3 so I I highly suspect we need to file some issues if we 
  haven't already um it will be V3 spec and say listen here's the 
  other mechanisms let's have a road map for when we can support 
  those as well.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And by the other mechanisms I mean of course.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So there's the related mechanism that open 
  badges uses for for translating credentials there's the European 
  learning data model internationalization scheme and then there's 
  uh just the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  General verifiable credential VC data model 
  2.0 way of international law.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ing so so we do need to align on that stuff 
  eventually.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Anyone else questions concerns.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Chairs how do we feel about making 1 of our 
  roadmap goals uh for next year uh which is to issue credentials 
  of membership in uh in the group.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ccg member and you attend the call here's a 
  here's a VC edu badge by 5 credenza.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We could tell.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh please do please do right like we we could 
  be the first um task force or group in a w3c.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's do it we can lead by example.
<ildiko_mazar> I think I may have already built myself a sample 
  EDC for the VC Edu Co-Chairship earlier this year (blush)
<dmitri_zagidulin> lol NICE
<kaliya_identity_woman> This is Diffusion of Innovation "theory"
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah that's a really good point the 10 times 
  better thing is tough right because I think it's really Kalia 
  points out in chat of that this relates to the diffusion of 
  innovation Theory.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Everett Rogers
<ildiko_mazar> It would already be 10 times better is digital 
  credentials were implemented at a greater scale
Eric_Shepherd: Simone I tried to raise my hand but I couldn't 
  couldn't do it very successfully um another way of looking at it 
  rather than saying 10 times better is to think of a force diagram 
  so what are the uh forces pushing things forward and what's 
  what's the forces pushing it back so and and then you can help 
  build on the forces pushing forward and neutralize the forces 
  pushing back so force is pushing back might be political we've 
  always done it this way it might be Financial uh to change our 
  systems and processes is going to be expensive it might be 
  ownership but analyzing that those forces in play can can uh 
  often help you identify why why things are not happening that 
  seem obvious that they should be happening.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah it's a really good point thanks Eric.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The other the other reason that I think that I 
  think we should uh take it on as a as a roadmap item specifically 
  issuing a verifiable credential for membership to the task force 
  or like having attended a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A uh a call is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If we write it up as a case study.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Because it's it's a use case that everybody 
  can understand right just membership in a group but in when you 
  start getting down to the details what's the data model going to 
  be and what's going to be the operational friction of like.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Grace Rachmany is working on this 
  use-case
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Does it mean that there's a 3 co-authors the 
  signing key going to be stored well we could we could all like 
  paste paste the seed for the signing private key into our 
  password managers right but until or we can use a key management 
  system on the cloud but but until you read a case study and 
  realize that oh in order for for me to issue even the simplest of 
  credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Needs to control the the signing key and and 
  how do you do that organizationally I I think that that might be 
  helpful for people.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It says Grace with Manny is working on this 
  use case which use case group membership.
Kaliya Young:  Yeah group belonging group membership as like her 
  primary focus.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A very cool do do you have a link is there 
  like repo or group or project.
Kaliya Young:  Uh I have documents that I'm not sure are public 
  yet but I could definitely introduce her and invite her like in 
  you guys could see if she's a fit to come and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah yeah could you could you do that yeah 
  just just like start start an email thread uh CC icos Simon and 
  myself and and her and just be like hey come come talk to come 
  talk about group membership at VC Edge that would be wonderful.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Other thoughts questions.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think a couple of iws uh previously IBEW 
  itself was I think offering um.
<david_ward> How can something like https://sigstore.dev be used 
  with VCs for short-lived keys instead of having to keep the keys 
  by the issuers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh uh conference attendance badges through 
  some partner or other.
Kaliya Young:  Some ambitious startups were uh were working on 
  that and like piggybacked off us sure but I don't know it didn't 
  necessarily come from us right but we were like oh God.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right right right right.
Kaliya Young:  Actually I think we're actually getting to the 
  point where.
Kaliya Young:  W40 it would be great to do honestly.
Kaliya Young:  You know I think.
Kaliya Young:  People also understand how incredibly budget 
  constrained iaw is like it it um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh for sure.
Kaliya Young:  That's what it does really well and it there isn't 
  a lot of cushion around the edges for.
Kaliya Young:  Interesting projects so we'll see.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  David Worden chat uh points points at sigstore 
  Dev and ask a question of.
<simone_ravaioli> Would you rather want a T-shirt or a Credential 
  ?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Would it be possible to use something like 
  that to do short-lived Keys uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Simone asks and Chad would you rather want a 
  t-shirt or credential how about both a t-shirt that is a 
  credential just print the QR code and you're done.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh David do you want to do you want to speak 
  to your question.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But we can hear you we can hear you go ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It does it does what that requires to make it 
  work is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Issue Registries essentially you you need an 
  initial register mechanism that is flexible enough.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To be able to uh uh show that you know I 
  delegated to the signing key even though the key itself like 
  lasts for an hour or whatever I I delegated to it from the you 
  know top level key or so yes like something like that would 
  definitely be possible I just don't think we're there yet 
  infrastructure and specification wise.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah it's a really good.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right well last call other other thoughts 
  and questions otherwise we can end a bit early give everybody a 
  chance to go get call.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And I really appreciate the the discussion so 
  far this has been interesting.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right takeaways let's start a Google doc 
  or VC samples and let's issue group membership credential.
<jeff_o_/_humanos> You guys are great! Have a great Holiday!
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And thank you all uh we let us all reconvene 
  uh after New Year's.
<ildiko_mazar> Happy holidays

[22:06] <drummond> Andrew Jones: joined Digital Bazaar in February, working on the DID test suite
[22:06] <dlongley> scribe: drummond
[22:07] <drummond> Bill Barnhill has done previous work on standards at OASIS and is now back to help. He has been working on AI and semantic technology in the defense consulting industry.
[22:07] <drummond> ...and is also an active open source contributor.
[22:10] <drummond> Drummond briefly reviewed the agenda and emphasized that today's goal is to see if we can get through the rest of the matrix parameter discussion and PRs.
[22:12] <drummond> Topic: DID Resolution Spec draft
[22:12] <drummond> markus_sabadello: Showed the revised structure of the DID Resolution spec.
[22:12] == gannan_ [~gannan@public.cloak] has joined #ccg
[22:13] <drummond> ...He has revised it into major sections: Resolving a DID and Deferencing a DID URL. This will help keep these two concepts and stages clear.
[22:13] <drummond> The DID Resolution section covers resolving a DID to a DID document.
[22:14] <drummond> The Dereferencing a DID URL section covers how the resolver acts on additional components in a DID URL to produce a final result.
[22:15] <drummond> Another section, DID Resolution Result, defines the kinds of results that DID Resolution can provide.
[22:15] <drummond> Another section, Service Endpoint Construction, specifies the algorithm for constructing a result URL when a DID URL includes a "service" parameter.
[22:16] <drummond> ...Markus also worked on the Introduction and Terminology sections.
[22:17] <drummond> ...He warned that there are still many uncompleted parts of the draft, and asks that contributors refrain from making PRs against the empty sections until they have been populated (or by checking with him).

[22:27] <aljones15> did:urn:324234234234;uuid:example=1
[22:27] <markus_sabadello> drummond: We are using them as part of DID URL syntax, but we are not redefining path, query, fragment themselves.
[22:28] <dlongley> i said this in an email: "In my view, the purpose of a DID URL is to create a stable reference to existing information about a specific thing, where the precise location of that information may change over time because of changes in the DID Document. It's a pointer." -- matrix parameters assist with this
[22:29] <markus_sabadello> drummond: There has been discussion whether matrix parameters like "service-type" are needed, since 1. you could just resolve a DID document and then search manually, and 2. you can always use #keys-1 fragment syntax to point to a part of a DID document.

[22:44] <drummond> ...so the question is really one of whether identification of objects of a specific type is needed.
[22:45] <drummond> ...The next parameter that seems to have support is version-id and version-time. These seem to be needed for identification. However there is a case that they could be selected using out-of-band resolution parameters.

[23:03] <dlongley> a more general way to say "refer to this other thing" ... id="foo";endpoint=true ... would be the same meaning as "service"

[23:17] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: again -1 on service-type and key-type, these should be resolver options for retrieval, not for identification
[23:17] <rhiaro> +1 what dmitri said
[23:17] * rhiaro reading though, not listening
[23:17] <markus_sabadello> drummond: are we sure there may not be a need to _identify_ a set of services or keys by types
[23:18] <markus_sabadello> kyle_denhartog: in signal protocol, they do "ratcheting", there's a need to identify a "depth" of ratchet
[23:18] <markus_sabadello> kyle_denhartog: e.g. you need to identify the 8th key in the ratchet
[23:19] <markus_sabadello> kyle_denhartog: you don't want to update your DID document every time you change the ratchet to a new key
[23:19] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: don't try to solve all levels of protocol/application use cases; let's stick to the core DID ABNF level

[23:20] <markus_sabadello> drummond: matrix parameters are for identification. use case for "key-type" may be stronger than "service-type"
[23:21] <markus_sabadello> drummond: want to be able to create a DID URL that identifies a set of service in a DID document, you can then store that e.g. in a database

[23:21] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: we'll end up stuffing a general graph traversal or query language into matrix parameters. that doesn't feel right design-wise.

[23:23] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: this kind of query language should be realized with resolver options, not matrix parameters
[23:24] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: the IoT use case can still be realized that way, no need for *-type matrix parameters

[23:25] <codenamedmitri> drummond - how would you feel about a general ‘type’ matrix param, to go alongside the general ‘id’ param?
[23:25] <drummond> markus_sabadello: still torn about the different use cases
[23:25] <drummond> q+ to answer dmitri
[23:25] <voip-ccg> drummond has been added to the queue: kyle_denhartog, drummond
[23:26] <drummond> ...gave the example of more complex queries that could be expressed in matrix parameters, very much like many HTTP URL queries
[23:27] <drummond> ...since it's still a URL, there is precedent for it
[23:27] <drummond> ...he still comes back to, "Do we have a use case for identification?"
[23:27] <drummond> ...do we want to be able to identify a node in an RDF document in a DID URL?

[23:29] <markus_sabadello> kyle_denhartog: if i want to group my keys by all "ed25519*" verification types (whether it's ed25519-2017,  ed25519-2018,  ed25519-2019), how would that work?

[23:29] <markus_sabadello> kyle_denhartog: for example in TLS, i may want to use a list of cypersuites... rather than providing a complete list, can i just use an identifier that can be dereferenced to a list?

[23:31] <markus_sabadello> drummond: considering a generic "type" matrix parameter similar to a generic "id" parameter
[23:31] <markus_sabadello> drummond: difference is that "id" is unique, but "type" is not
[23:31] <markus_sabadello> codenamedmitri: but that's the same with "service-type" and "key-type", they're not unique
[23:32] <markus_sabadello> drummond: sounds right, i guess generic "type" could work, let's think about it

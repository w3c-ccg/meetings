Harrison_Tang: Welcome welcome everyone uh to this week's w3c ccg 
  meeting uh today we're very excited to have a Jeremy and Andrea 
  to uh come here and present uh on BBS plus signature schemes 
  benchmarks.
Harrison_Tang: But before we uh go to the main agenda I just want 
  to quickly remind everyone the code of ethics and professional 
  conduct just want to make sure we have a constructive and helpful 
  conversations here.
Harrison_Tang: A quick note about intellectual property anyone 
  can participate in these calls however all substantive 
  contributions to any ccg core items must be member of the ctg 
  with a full IPR agreement signed so if you have any questions in 
  regards to the IP notes intellectual property notes or the w3c 
  account uh please feel free to just uh reach out to any of the 
  cultures.
Harrison_Tang: Couple quick notes in regards to uh the calls uh 
  these calls are automatically being recorded and transcribed and 
  we will publish the meeting minutes the audio and video recording 
  in the next 24 to 48 hours.
Harrison_Tang: We use TI chat if you the speaker so you can type 
  in Q Plus to add yourself to the Q or Q minus to remove uh and 
  you can uh.
Harrison_Tang: New question mark to see who is in the queue.
Harrison_Tang: Right so uh just want to take a quick moment for 
  the introductions and reintroduction so if you're new to the 
  community or you haven't been active and want to re-engage uh 
  feel free to just unmute and uh introduce yourself.
<jaromil> ahoy!
Harrison_Tang: See mostly familiar faces so.
Harrison_Tang: Move on to the next topic.
Harrison_Tang: I think General can introduce himself once we get 
  to the main presentations.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh announcements and reminders uh any 
  new announcements or reminders.
Manu Sporny:  Uh hi Harrison um yeah just a couple of um kind of 
  notes uh on things that happened at the worldwide Web Consortium 
  technical plenary that happened 2 weeks ago in the uh California 
  DMV hackathon which included verifiable credentials uh and mdl uh 
  last week um uh so the the high-level feedback from w3t pack is 
  that uh the did working group work uh is going well that was a a 
  good 2 days of full-day meetings um the work items are proceeding 
  uh as plans you know real drama or anything you know we just kind 
  of got down to to to making progress on did core and the did 
  resolution specification so that went well um on the Wednesday 
  there was a breakout session um multiple breakout sessions so 
  like 40 breakout sessions um uh we did 1 on did method 
  standardization um uh which got.
Manu Sporny:  Decent bit of interest uh we suggested a web-based 
  Ed method and ephemeral did method and a a truly decentralized uh 
  did method um that uh proposal for working group Charter uh 
  received no objections um we will of course know like the people 
  in the room didn't object that doesn't mean there won't be people 
  that object but largely it was uh positive feedback on having uh 
  such a a working group uh as some of you know that did method 
  standardization work is happening as a joint uh work item between 
  ccg um uh trust over IP decentralized identity Foundation uh 
  those meetings are happening regularly now.
Manu Sporny:  The other thing that we put forward are a number of 
  the specifications that are being incubated in the ccg uh things 
  like render method uh confidence method um the uh uh hopefully in 
  the future verifiable credentials over Wireless the verifiable 
  credential barcode stuff um uh VC API uh those were all proposed 
  as uh going standards track again um nobody in the room uh 
  objected to uh that work proceeding that would probably be around 
  next summer so still quite a ways from that for a recharter um uh 
  and then finally the verifiable credential working group uh met 
  um that went really well many of us got to meet uh Simone for the 
  first time which was great um uh to meet him in in person as his 
  role as the security uh lead at w3c um we uh have agreed to go 
  into a second candidate recommendation with all the 
  specifications we believe we're pretty much done.
Manu Sporny:  Um with them at this point um and the only thing 
  that we're really uh waiting on right now uh the only thing that 
  we're really waiting on is uh Security review um uh on uh those 
  specifications which we'll be working with uh the new uh newly 
  chartered um security uh interest group uh saying on um we are 
  hoping that uh by q1 of next year will be able to have uh 
  standard uh standards w3c standards published for fiber 
  credential data model uh the securing specifications uh status 
  list um things like that um.
Manu Sporny:  The other thing that happened was the uh California 
  DMB hackathon.
Manu Sporny:  They were 15 organizations that participated really 
  great amazing use cases um uh the usage of verifiable credentials 
  was around 10 out of the 15 organizations used the verifiable 
  credential version of the driver's license uh the rest used the 
  mdl there were in-person use cases uh many of them were online 
  use cases um and so we got some really good feedback um from that 
  uh Google was there Apple was there uh providing uh support uh 
  along with uh us uh providing support for the verifiable 
  credential stuff um and and and so and so forth so um good kind 
  of momentum building uh confidence in the technology roll out to 
  production uh that that sort of thing um I will also note that um 
  uh Lucy uh Yang was there um.
Manu Sporny:  As well as uh Clea and Gail Hodges from open ID 
  Foundation um Sharon Lowe was there uh as as a judge um uh Lucy 
  did an amazing job um you know keeping uh the whole event running 
  on on the rails as did uh Gail so uh there's a another event the 
  government hackathon in a in a month's time November 1st um but 
  it was a really great turnout uh really good to see the community 
  building things and uh rolling them into production uh that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
Kaliya Young:  Sure um just a reminder that internet identity 
  Workshop is coming up at the end of the month.
Kaliya Young:  Um October 29 to.
Kaliya Young:  31St bring your Halloween costumes it will be fun 
  and um.
Kaliya Young:  The other thing is on the day before you've got 
  the community events there's like an interesting vrm event the 
  shaping up um vendor relationship management Community has their 
  Monday thing and I think the open ID Foundation has something too 
  so um.
Kaliya Young:  And just a reminder too we're committed to 
  accessibility.
Kaliya Young:  If you want to be there.
Kaliya Young:  Um speak to us and we will help make that where 
  are you.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Clea.
Harrison_Tang: We will hold the ccg meeting uh that week so on on 
  October 29th we will not have a ccg meeting because of the 
  internet identity Workshop so I'll send out the calendar 
  reminder.
Harrison_Tang: A weekend event.
Harrison_Tang: Okay any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: All right so next week we'll have Carrie uh to 
  talk about MIT digital credentials Consortium updates and then 
  the week after we'll have Krista Allen uh come back and talk 
  about uh his latest on Gordon envelope and Gordon's seal 
  transport uh protocol.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh moving on um any updates uh in 
  regards to the work items.
Harrison_Tang: So last calls for introductions announcements will 
  work item related um topics.
Harrison_Tang: I think there's a working group around 
  multi-format like multi key multi hash right like working group 
  maybe we can collaborate with them.
Harrison_Tang: Oh cool great idea.
Harrison_Tang: Um any other topics people want bring up.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda so today 
  again very excited to have Jerry Mill and Andrea here to talk 
  about the BBS plus signature scheme benchmarks uh I think they 
  have shared with the ccg public list and then I also include a 
  link to uh Jeremy blog post uh in the agenda uh that I sent out 
  last week but uh without further Ado uh Jeremy please take it 
  over.
Harrison_Tang: Yep we can see you and hear you.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I guess you can see the screen and uh yeah 
  I'll switch on the video but if there is any problem with the 
  connection let me know that uh I'll save that but that bit of 
  bandwidth.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So uh I'm here with Andrea my colleague and 
  um yeah we run we had fun running this Benchmark for the BBS 
  briefly where we come from is a small Foundation based in 
  Amsterdam.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: A lot from the w3c so we are very happy to 
  be members now we grew enough through European projects our main 
  um contractor is the European commission for which we have done 
  several projects 1 Flagship success stories uh in ICT mostly.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And we do this as you see with the 
  interdisciplinary approach.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um everything we do is free and open source 
  uh so everything you find in this presentation is running on code 
  that you can download test.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Well you are familiar with the licensing and 
  the story of the group project 1 big more on top of this slide 
  maybe is that most of the things you are going to see their 
  implemented in C language.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And this is the platform that we use to run 
  the benchmarks that you are shown.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: It is grew GPL software that we are 
  developing since 2018 most of it has been uh most of the research 
  and development in it has been funded by European projects and 
  today we are very happy to to to use it for for our work for our 
  daily work it is relevant to say this because this is the main 
  platform The Benchmark is running on it is a virtual machine is 
  very portable so the computations are applicable.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I mean we.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Target also was so it runs on also in 
  browser.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Obviously these leads to different 
  performances all performances that we we see today they are 
  running on uh PC.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I will give the specs later on.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And last bit about us why uh we got here uh 
  obviously I mean uh sheer passion for making things work well and 
  making code uh transparent code run on most of our devices uh but 
  also the fact that we are involved we are deeply involved in 
  Europe and this initiative the European digital identity 
  architecture reference framework eud are known as is running is 
  shaking a little bit the the stages were um identity is um is 
  discussed at least on this side of the pond and it is um yeah as 
  you just I I put this slide you are all familiar with how and 
  what an identity digital identity wallet should be doing this is 
  the the framework in which it falls as a as a web mobile 
  application slash web app that can be also implemented as.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And um yeah these this initiative has had 
  already.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Some feedback uh also critical feedback 
  which I think is the most valuable because that's the way to make 
  it better and the most important feedback came from uh this bunch 
  of people you can see among them some superheroes of cryptography 
  so quite some authoritative names that made uh the commission 
  notes that the algorithms used especially in a cryptographic 
  level in the ldr are not really sound why I say this because 
  that's really how I come to study BBS plus uh we are interested 
  in these algorithm because it's mature.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: In my opinion could have been standardized a 
  bit earlier but yeah here we are and um and it's a good 
  substitute because it brings in the feature of unlabeled so this 
  is the the real reason why we are here and and you know 
  contributing and and sharing.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: This VBS uh plus Benchmark so the QR code is 
  clickable I think um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: There are slides um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I I'll share the slides at the end of this 
  presentation and uh here you can find the article that uh uh that 
  I wrote and circulated about this.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh there is another relevant article that I 
  will use as a reference uh in this Benchmark uh it's SD BLS we we 
  made a new scheme uh which we are not proposing as a production 
  ready for BBS plus but we had Farm demonstrating some other 
  features that we believe should be in a uh digital identity 
  credential uh selected disclosure credential scheme in particular 
  threshold revocation while doing this we implemented a BLS 
  signature with Selective disclosure uh protection from replay 
  attacks uh several features you find into this article recently 
  published the link is to the open publication by the way on axis.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Here is because as a term of comparison in 
  The Benchmark I also bring in this to show how faster is BBS plus 
  that was anticipate the result so it makes sense actually to to 
  look still look at BBS plus even if today BLS signatures can be 
  done um in many other ways.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So let's Dive In.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh this is the fastest uh explained quickest 
  explained part of the Benchmark uh this is what you see up is a 
  bit of a.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: On where the benchmarks were running inside 
  our VM um and yeah you have to consider that the VM uh has a 
  direct syntax parser made in Lua which is um also a dialect of 
  Lua in fact I overloaded a lot of operators so that it looks like 
  Mathematica that's why we have students from mathematics working 
  with us and and implementing algorithms like we as plus so we 
  implemented it very similar to what um a proof in Sage or 
  Mathematica would look like and um and it runs straight in 
  production uh but you have still to consider that the benchmarks 
  uh initialize from C alua VM so.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Some things could be done faster.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  this is.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Please keep our generation so uh just 
  straight on hashing power um the generation takes uh almost 0.003 
  seconds.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  so you.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: See this the number of keys in 2 seconds a 
  thousand keys were generated on in our tests.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Issuance more interesting um first fact is 
  that is definitely linear growth.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh as you see in a thousand a thousand 
  issued credentials uh will take also to verify uh pretty much the 
  same time will take 1 second.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: For a thousand of them.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So yeah the Layman um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: That we will say here is really like 1 
  second to issue a thousand credentials.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: The presentation and verification are 
  usually the trickiest as you know we are talking about zero 
  knowledge proof um algorithm so um this is our results uh also 
  published in the article uh you see that the growth of proving is 
  steeper so verification will scale slightly better.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I guess this difference is quite negligible 
  but uh yeah we can say that uh verification takes uh less.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And just to as I as I uh anticipated just to 
  put it in perspective.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um sdbl is an implementation of bonelang 
  sakam uh signatures so.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Multiplications of our elliptic curves and 
  in pairing uh which BBS plus Repro reproduces its own way uh but.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: This is like playing on playing on the same 
  curve the BLS 3812 um this is the result of sdbs uh with issue 
  proven verification uh we see clearly that BBS plus is 1 uh 
  magnitude faster than a BLS signature implementation I think this 
  is a relevant result it makes sense to use BBS plus not only 
  because it's it's a a bit older and more tested uh well 1 could 
  argue that BLS signatures are also quite tested on on top of a 
  lot of Bank of a blockchain implementations but still um you know 
  in the same conditions um with the default ROM uh settings so the 
  the order of the curve and the generators that BBS plus is 
  customizing with the default ones on the BBS 3812.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Then um yeah we really have an improvement 
  in performance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So again uh Layman result for this uh um 
  Benchmark uh 1 second for 1,000 credential presentations almost a 
  second and a half for a thousand credential verifications.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Things can be optimized but this is what we 
  got in our environment.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Now to the Layman results very quick of the 
  size sizes are quite good again I don't have here a comparison 
  with sdbs but I can tell you as I brought the paper and and went 
  through its implementation uh this is very very compact compared 
  to what happens with uh BLS signatures uh so remarkably compact 
  of course we are talking about the sort of compression of second 
  order curve points using the zcash compression so taking only 1 
  coordinate it gets down to 96 bytes for public Keys 80 bytes for 
  issued signatures and zero knowledge proofs down to 272 bites.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Which is very interesting if you consider 
  that a mobile wallet holding 100s in 100 kilobyte in 10 kilobyte 
  sorry and proof will will fit into QR code and even most NFC 
  tags.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Which is not the case for our comparison 
  implementation in BBs.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> SD-BLS sizes:
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So yes please.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: It grows linearly yes.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh Jeremy I will shoot at the 
  grow.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Wait a second.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: I'm not 100% sure.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Wait a second um.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: I can make a quick test but uh.
Harrison_Tang: Hey man you have a similar question.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah well no it uh uh just an answer uh they do 
  grow so the way BBS um uh works is that um the more you hide the 
  larger the signature the less you hide the smaller the signature 
  uh and so the the bytes that are Mill showing are are accurate 
  right um it it depends on the number of claims that you have in 
  the credential and it depends on how many uh you're trying to 
  hide uh but that is well within you know the the number that uh 
  your emails uh showing on there um we also have um some this is 
  fantastic work by the way our Mill Andre like this is this is 
  this is great stuff it's really wonderful that you've done an 
  independent uh you know review and demonstration of it the 
  numbers that you're showing are very much in line with the 
  numbers that that we found um but yeah we're happy to show some 
  of the the um how how BBs um you know the signature sizes change 
  based on what your uh.
Manu Sporny:   The the amount of.
Manu Sporny:  Um you know in.
Manu Sporny:  That you're trying to uh disclosed but but they're 
  they're the the the again going to this Layman's result like.
Manu Sporny:   The lay.
Manu Sporny:  Is like yeah they're really small signature sizes 
  for what they're you know uh signing you you don't really get 
  even close with many of the other you know approaches.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yes it's not super easy in my setup right 
  now to open up the Benchmark terminal and show the Json uh it 
  would be unwieldy now but uh well I can confirm from my 
  understanding that selectively disclosures with multiple 
  credentials will grow linearly uh yet there is not yet a SD BBS 
  Plus.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I know some people in Europe are paid to 
  work on it um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And so when when there would be a format for 
  SD uh we will see really like how how it fits into the protocol 
  if they find any opportunity to to tame down the growth but my 
  understanding is that it would grow linearly for each proof.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh guys I am making test now it 
  doesn't seem to me that they grow but uh maybe we can uh make 
  some proper tests and share the results later.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yeah it depends what we are looking at but 
  yeah I go on with the presentation then we look at um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Perhaps I can fire up here the The Benchmark 
  terminal.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um okay are there any other questions about 
  this part because I'm moving in the the last part of the 
  presentation then.
Harrison_Tang: Oh wait I I have a question based on what you show 
  so far BBS is better than BLS signature so my question is why 
  would other applications like blockchains like use the BLS why 
  don't they just move to the DBS.
Harrison_Tang: Or are there is like are there certain things that 
  BLS do better than BBS or it's it's just a BBS is strictly 
  better.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I see a lot of people doing strange things 
  so in in blockchain space.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh do you want me to try to answer 
  Jeremy.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yeah please Andrea.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: So uh uh Harrison we we wrote a 
  paper the name of the paper is SD BLS standing for selected 
  disclosure and they're basically we experimented through 
  different phases we experimented different uh features.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh and uh uh t tldr.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Our uh our implementation as the 
  as the BLS is slower is visibly slower than BBS plus but it 
  offers features that BBS plus doesn't have for example revocation 
  cryptographic revocation which is something we know that BBS team 
  is working on.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: So it's it's uh if you compared 
  speed only then BBS wins then if you look at a certain features 
  there are other cryptographic schemes that offer features that 
  aren't currently available in BBS Plus.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Okay yes in the meantime.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  I I made.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Some progress to fire up the terminal and we 
  can look at the the Json row data later on if you want.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And make some tests.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Any other question until this part.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So I have 1.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I don't I'm not I'm not sure it's really 
  irrelevant answer to your question but the only reason I would 
  see in not using BBS plus is that because of its ROM setup and 
  with that I mean because of the hardcoded generators.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Mbps plus only BLS 381 uh 12 is implemented.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And it is not transferable on bigger curves.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So BLS as the advantage that I could go on 
  on a bigger course achieving more bits and therefore more 
  security.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But still I will be in a framework that is 
  not post-quantum secure.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um but yeah that that could be a reason that 
  is more portable to use BLS.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um the next um tests that I did uh is um 
  attempt at privacy analysis I use 2 methods 1 I believe more 
  interesting is measuring the Hamming distance between um BBS plus 
  proofs.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Generated on the same credential.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And comparing them with the Hamming distance 
  of random generators.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Here that you.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: 3 random generators different in comparison 
  1 is the prng in the room another 1 is the prng in the room 
  seeded with random from random.org.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And the the third 1 is openssl.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So I put these in um in a graph where you 
  see the frequency of distance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Recording distances and the white you see on 
  the left and right it means that nothing has occurred outside of 
  that uh distance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: See that the frequency zooming in on uh just 
  10 samples so here are like it's very few samples uh it is 
  restricted between a 1030 a 1080 which is absolutely normal this 
  is visible also um on 100 samples.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Where we have um this is group plot so there 
  is some transparency so the the darkest color it means that there 
  is overlapping.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And um yeah let's let's keep an eye on this 
  guy here on the on the right side uh Manu you've wrote about it 
  in a male and I think you are right it's worth investigating uh 
  when we get to um many more samples.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh we see that there is uniform 
  distribution.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But there is still this guy here.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: It's a it's a sort of a spike.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Around a thousand 140.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um I have no idea why that occurs.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But it's consistent.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um Shannon averages yes please will.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Harming distance is when you take 2 octets 
  so 2 arrays of bytes.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh let's zoom in to arrays of bits.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And you put them on top of each other and 
  you see if the bits are the same or not.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: If the bits are the same there is no 
  distance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And if the bits in the same position change 
  there is a distance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And it's used the even like down in in the 
  in the kernel to and in the compiler to um compute difference 
  between data on a bit resolution.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So bits on top and yeah you know like there 
  is never complete on a bit level there is never complete distance 
  so the distance will be always lower than the length of the data 
  you're comparing.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But there will be a a a consistent number of 
  distance between a random data.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And if data is Not So Random then you will 
  start seeing less distance.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So the number will go down.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um Shannon entropy is measured on the.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um on the signal basically uh on the on the 
  the entropy of the signal so how unpredictable it is let's say um 
  that is well documented also on Wikipedia how it works we have a 
  simple implementation in the room.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I can show you the code later on it's not 
  that big.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Wrote it myself in C with pass it some tests 
  this is my measurement of it so um the values are the same for 
  random generated things.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I mean the the the difference is negligible 
  also here.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And very close to each other so this is also 
  a visualization with gnu plot of the values.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh of shamanthy and you see the narrow I 
  mean although we have some wiggling but it's between 098 and 0965 
  so.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: It's it's constantly good uh Shannon entropy 
  values.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So my conclusion is that the encoding of a 
  BBS plus proof appears as random data to the outside Observer uh 
  with the reserve that yeah it's worth investigating that random 
  Spike around a thousand 140 on Hamming distance measurements.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: A future directions if I would have more 
  time.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: What I would do.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh and I we try but honestly this was done 
  in August and we were on the beach and and uh yeah it's uh it's 
  becoming busy again at work um but yeah the future directions i c 
  1 is fat seeing stress testing uh because in Zen room we 
  implemented uh some easy functions for attacking uh cryptographic 
  algorithms so far there has been used for implementing a 
  cryptographic algorithms but since we have some clients that ask 
  us to develop new algorithms and since we do that quite fast we 
  would like to have a good testing pipeline um and um yeah we 
  build some fudging uh stress testing Primitives uh if you don't 
  know the matasano challenges they are a great exercises free 
  online and um it's fun for cryptographers.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  they are.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Is like shaan and also RSA signatures things 
  that were proven in the past to be broken so in the matasano 
  challenges there are like these techniques explained and you have 
  to reimplement them so uh because we we all took those challenges 
  then we implemented them in the room and now we have easy 
  functions it will be as easy as uh running Hamming distance 
  measurements uh of what you have seen so maybe in the future we 
  will try what they consist of Imagine um the algorithm you change 
  at a certain point of all the flow you change only the first bit 
  of a signature or only the last bit of a signature or a random 
  bit or you shift it of 1 bit.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  so you change.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Things in the in the material and the in the 
  data and you see if the algorithm holds if if it doesn't crashes 
  if it's if it's not producing uh false results because even if a 
  bit changes in a signature it should not validate.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh it should not you know until you try.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Another uh feature direction that I see is 
  um coding the fastest BBS plus implementation in the west it 
  would be great fun to do that and I hope I find the time to do 
  that um I think the best way is to use lib blst.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And the Target also was I believe this would 
  lead to some very fast implementation will be interesting to 
  compare with my benchmarks here and see what goes obviously this 
  is a step later after standardization and uh I don't know if you 
  could could sell in the industry because this is like end to end 
  cryptographic algorithm so.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: We must see if if there will be need for 
  such a big optimization but yeah it will blsd is better than our 
  primitive Milagro we use Milagro um in the room the 1 written by 
  Mike Scott uh then donated to the Apache Foundation as incubator 
  we still use the original from Mike Scott uh which is a very nice 
  primitive because it doesn't have any memory allocation um but 
  leave the BLS is very popular in the crypto scene especially for 
  zero knowledge proofs and it has Us in the optimizations both for 
  arm and x86 platforms so it won't make sense it would be fun we 
  have um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Vectors to compare with so maybe we will do 
  it um yeah everything you have seen is based on um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: On I forgot to mention on the latest BBS 
  specification which came up came out like a month ago and um we 
  have matched all the vectors and we are following very closely 
  all new versions.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  uh so.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: We will manage to update also this if there 
  is any new version we hope there will be not new version uh um 
  and.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yeah last future direction will be 
  interesting perhaps also for Forks at w3c to Benchmark our 
  implementation of BBS inside browsers uh so their room can 
  already uh compiled to asthma we use it a lot into as as a 
  payload to browsers is like 2 megabytes less than 2 megabytes 
  payload you can npm install Zen room already and it runs in 
  browser so we can already run BBS Plus in browser uh but I just 
  didn't bother to make the Benchmark comparison uh I guess it will 
  be 1 order of magnitude is lower um it will be interesting to do 
  uh just here again lack of time but if you're interested we can 
  team up and um yeah we take stage students also for this so we 
  can we can always put some young people on this tooling because 
  it's well documented and not so hard to run um and then run it 
  into a JavaScript environment.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  so that's all.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh a bit of advertisement for our group uh 
  I'm co-chairing a group at w3c I'm very happy about this is the 
  the threat modeling community group uh together with Simon and AI 
  who is here and uh yeah if you want to join us for Less technical 
  things you are very welcome there uh fun fun trivia the threat.
<simone_onofri> we're also starting with Greg the work on VCDM
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Was born because we noticed that in the ldr 
  um specification in Europe there was no threat model so so it's 
  very hard to discuss about um you know security without a threat 
  model and uh yeah that that would be probably 1 of the first 
  things we will start working on.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thanks a lot any questions.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah this is.
Manu Sporny:  A wonderful work uh why this is uh great to see um 
  you know all of this stuff recreated by independent uh 
  organizations uh it's going to be a a huge help to the security 
  review that's going on at ITF and uh the worldwide Web Consortium 
  um uh the you had mentioned in the article that you're also 
  looking into um doing the same kind of uh kind of analysis on the 
  w3c uh BBS data Integrity specifications do you uh was that did I 
  misread that or um is there plans to kind of look at um the the 
  higher level uh cryptographic protocol um because I think the 
  analysis you've done today is the lower level of BBS kind of core 
  cryptographic Primitives um uh what has to be done now of course 
  is um either whether it's uh SD BLS or S Ebbs or or jwp or the 
  data Integrity BBS uh crypto.
Manu Sporny:   It's a w3c.
Manu Sporny:  Um are you.
Manu Sporny:  Planning on uh taking a look at uh those higher 
  level kind of uh cryptographic protocols as as well.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I think my colleague Andrea is more busy on 
  that you consider that I will stay more on the cryptographic 
  lower level and less on the protocol level and also because of 
  the tools we are developing and the way we are working but 
  Andreas has just some good news that the EC is also sponsoring us 
  for um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: A new project I I don't spoil it Andrea if 
  you want to tell about it.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Yes Man uh we are definitely 
  looking at those very soon uh we got a small Grant to implement 
  uh uh something that initially will be an aod ARF compliance 
  tool.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Is I hear a lot of noise.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Go on we can hear you well.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Okay um and actually in writing 
  the application we got deeply inspired by uh the the VC 
  playground as well as the can I can I vc.com.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: And uh we initially will focus 
  only on audr but very very soon we going to move to uh different 
  uh.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Data formats and uh protocols so 
  definitely yes and uh I will uh we will ping you regarding uh the 
  VC API and we'll also ping you trying to get an interview from 
  you on to give us feedback on what you like to see on this 
  application.
<manu_sporny> That's great, wonderful!
Manu Sporny:  No no problem happy to help.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yes some handholding in the in the quantity 
  of literature uh is is always welcome and and yeah the project is 
  an exciting project it was the brainchild also of purya and it's 
  of course learning from the w3c attitude because I remember 
  clearly uh 1 of the first things that came out with the worldwide 
  web was a a validator of HTML Pages very useful hosted by so we 
  want a validator for all this and uh we'll go through of course I 
  mean this this will be very useful uh for BBS Plus for the Audi 
  is the first thing.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But um Andre I don't know if I should say it 
  but really I mean I I would never suggest um a client to use the 
  odf for for credentials I I don't even go to test the sdj sdj 
  implementation from a cryptographic.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  point of.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh uh you know BBS plus should be definitely 
  the the 1 considered.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: We all agreed SMS.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: It would be ARF SMS.
Harrison_Tang: Simone I think you're on the queue.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: If anyone wants to dig deeper into the.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  the point.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Questions were posed about the scalability 
  we can on a on a terminal.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah on on the scalability I have um 1 1 Edition 
  but before before I do that going back to kind of Wes's um sorry 
  um will abramson's uh question around the Hamming distance it's a 
  really interesting for those of you that you know don't don't uh 
  aren't steeped in in cryptography it's a really interesting 
  measure on whether or not the cryptography is actually working uh 
  let me see if I can hopefully I can screen share um here um so 
  like this is a picture of a penguin right this is tux Linux Linux 
  penguin um and if we're going to encrypt it what we would expect 
  to see once we encrypted it is something that looks like this 
  it's just like noise like you can't tell that there that's the 
  penguin that was like encrypted um and this is an example of like 
  you know having good Hamming distance uh when you do that kind of 
  check um but there was a uh there was a security failure many 
  years ago where when you encrypted that image.
Manu Sporny:  Would get something like this.
Manu Sporny:  This is an example of like really poor Hamming 
  distance like you know exactly what has been encrypted even 
  though it's gone through a quote unquote you know block Cipher 
  encrypted encryption algorithm so when um when yaml was talking 
  about Hamming distance this is the type of thing that he was 
  measuring he wanted to make sure we were in this in this case 
  which is what he showed with that nice uh curve um instead of 
  this case where you would not have seen that nice curve you would 
  have seen something uh else um when it came to kind of Hamming 
  distance so it's 1 of those really neat things that you can kind 
  of check uh to see if you're uh encryption and cryptography is 
  working the way you think it's it's working um as for the um the 
  uh the proof size chain changing um I think Andrea was correct 
  the signature size the initial signature size on BBS doesn't 
  change so the when the initial signature doesn't change but I 
  believe the.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> let me check
Manu Sporny:  Change as you reveal or or hide more information 
  because you have to uh include um the um uh the the hidden kind 
  of values in a in a way and that adds to the the the derived 
  signature um the the the zero knowledge proof um that's it.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um I shared other computer but I yeah I'm 
  back no can you hear me.
Manu Sporny:  Yep yeah we can hear you.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah you're back yeah I think uh.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So I was showing I just run again the.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Benchmark so this is the terminal of the 
  benchmark.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And I want to proceed all around.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Yeah this is the how The Benchmark is done 
  it's a simple script you find in.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  I I.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Committed to the to the source code so you 
  will find it in the test Benchmark BBs.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Maybe some feeding with the bill.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: You'll get this eventually I forgot to 
  mention that shake 256 or sha 256 um are pretty much the same.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  so I just.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Take which is also known as shortly.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: As hashing for BBs.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  yeah this.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Were the timings.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And and the sizes I get here.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: The size benchmarks.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Here the proofs each proof is is it takes.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Let's say this is the context and then the 
  public key the the signature.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: From the issuer the message.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And uh uh ivy.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And um so the norms.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And yeah this is for each message.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So proof will be produced.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: For each new message and signature it is not 
  aggregated at least from what I can see.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: There is a possibility to aggregate um 
  signatures in in um in BLS space.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But the proofs I don't think so.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> @manu I found something  funky: 
  it appears that the proof size decreases proportionally to the 
  amount of elements disclosed :-|
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I was obviously not ready to answer these 
  questions so.
<manu_sporny> Yes, that's correct Andrea :)
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Sometimes with cryptography you get so deep 
  into 1 direction that you crawl back into the other is like sort 
  of difficult but yeah uh feel free for anyone that remembers Lua 
  feel free to play around with the benchmark.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh this is literally all the Benchmark the 
  room is like an interactive shell so you know it works like this 
  octet random and uh um oops uh I should have said octet.
<manu_sporny> The more you hide, the larger the proof. The less 
  you hide, the smaller the proof (at least, with BBS+)
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Uh whatever and then print em you show.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> no, I take back what I said
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So it it is Lua.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: You see this was the random in HEX.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And this is the random in binary and this is 
  literally the language that we use in.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Room so if you go and read the Keygen.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> no I take back again.. I was 
  right the first time!
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Implementation of our benchmark.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  you'll see.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: There is a bit of a boilerplate this is 
  clock for measuring the speed.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: But really the common is Keyon here and then 
  this is all down here is um.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Um all you know putting it into a a format 
  like new plot will take it.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> if you disclose 1 element from 
  the array, the length is 10, if you disclose 3 elements, the 
  length is 7
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So it is fairly easy and sizes is really the 
  simplest.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org:  so you can.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Hope through this create more proofs and see 
  it really grows linearly we don't have um functions for other 
  functions for the BBS.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> (10 and 7 are for representation 
  purposes)
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And by the way if you're interested we have.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: DBS implementation in Z code.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Which is this.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So that's how we use BBS this is the 
  implementation inside the room is create BBS Keys these are code 
  commands.
<harrison_tang> so manu is correct in that the more you hide, the 
  larger the size?
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: And uh they can take arguments.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: So that's how we make it used by 
  International Engineers so you can play with Zen code and create 
  multiple.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: Anyway yeah this for the Curious ones to 
  fiddle with.
<andrea_d'intino_|_forkbomb_bv> @manu "the more you hide" - 
  probably correct
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: This is the.
Jaromil_‚òÆÔ∏è_Dyne.org: I'll paste it.
Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you you're welcome.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions.
Harrison_Tang: So it's also uh clarify the chat so in BBS is it 
  true that the more you hide the larger the proof size is that 
  true like just because I think there's multiple chats like 
  happening.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: I did some tests.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: I can uh if you like I can share 
  my screen and show you what we're looking at.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: That we generated a signatures 
  with an array of 3 elements.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh in this case the elements are 
  above 18 Italian and Professor 3 strings.
https://github.com/dyne/zenroom inside test/benchmarks/bbs
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: And if you want to create a proof 
  where you only disclose 1 element.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Uh the proof is going to be 
  bigger.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: By disclosing 3 Elements which is 
  counterintuitive but I believe it matches what manager said The 
  more you hide.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: The more uh you the longer the 
  longer it is.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: It's not it's not the amount of 
  elements you want to disclose that makes it uh makes the proof 
  bigger it's the amount of elements you want to hide so you want 
  not to disclose.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you thanks a lot for clarification.
Harrison_Tang: All right any last uh comment or question.
Harrison_Tang: I think we're at a time.
<econnell> Thank you!
Harrison_Tang: Well thank you thank you uh ymo thank you Andrea 
  uh for jumping on here this is a great discussion so thanks a 
  lot.
Harrison_Tang: All right this concludes this week's ccg meeting 
  thanks.
Andrea_D'Intino_|_Forkbomb_BV: Thanks for having us.

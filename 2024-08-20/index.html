<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Great I think it&apos;s just me at the moment um anchors anchor will jump in in about 5 minutes or so um but yeah let&apos;s let&apos;s kick off uh I&apos;ll put this into slideshow mode as well um so I&apos;ll give a bit of context on what did linked resources are I think that some people on the call will have a broad understanding of what they can do others will be completely new to the space so I think we&apos;ll start from Basics and then we can get into some of the complexity later on um for a bit of context we&apos;ve we&apos;ve been working on this did linked resource standard for about 2 years now. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Last year we started writing the draft spec. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: W3c and that&apos;s got to a sort of v0.1 state now where we&apos;d love to have some contributions but I&apos;ll I&apos;ll get into that later in the in the presentation so I&apos;m going to run through what did looked resources are uh what applications there are at the moment in in sort of in yeah in the real world um how what problems did Lincoln resources solve um and their applications. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: So uh I guess the first question that I want to ask as a sort of rhetorical question is why are resources needed in digital identity and this kind of leads on to what resources are in this context. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: And sort of in a nutshell a resource can be any structured file um stored on Ledger uh or off Ledger this actually I should certainly update that to say off Ledger as well within a specific syntax um so in decentralized identity specifically we often use things like schemas status lists trust Registries as sort of files that we associate with. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials but the actual ways that these files are stored is often quite varied so for example schemas are a really good example of a resource uh they&apos;re used to describe the attributes within a verifiable credential in a machine readable format and you know prominent examples of where schemas are stored are schema.org uh which is probably the most common 1 uh then there&apos;s other sort of Alternatives such as you know the hyperledger Indy Community which uses on Ledger schemas. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Um and schemas are naturally used in identity documents and VCS uh and it they become increasingly important um when we&apos;re talking about verifying a credential because you need to be able to match that the actual credential you&apos;re being presented uh sort of conforms to the schema that is referenced in the credential. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Um so you know in an example uh so 1 example is you know here on the left hand side we have a schema shoot or a driver&apos;s license uh issued in 2012 and on the right hand side we have 1 in 2015 and what you can see is some of the attributes within the 1 in 2015 of being updated um but because both of these drivers licenses are still you know valid uh you know there&apos;s an overlap in terms of when they are both valid uh verifying applications will need to be able to discern uh or be able to verify both of these schemas at the same time so we need a way to be able to update these types of resources without 1 being sort of deprecated or 1 sort of uh resulting in an error. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Um so here you can see just a like a quick a quick glance that some of these attributes um on the right have been updated so this 1 includes height weight and eyes whereas the 1 on the left does not include white hypnosis um and we need to make sure that the 1 on issued in 2015 doesn&apos;t invalidate the 1 issued in 2012 um so both of these should still be higher level of assurance schemas. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: And this is a problem for apps in the real world specifically with regards to verifying credentials um and we&apos;ve all encountered you know computer says no. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Is in this context. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: If we don&apos;t learn from sort of the mistakes of the past where you know we we&apos;ve run into these issues then I think we&apos;re we&apos;re falling into a bit of trap with in this new sort of identity paradigm. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Similarly uh you know I think with regards to resources like schemas and Status lists. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Points of failure is also a really big potential issue in the space I think we&apos;ve seen a lot of convergence around the methods like did web did did tvw which I&apos;ll get on to it a bit later in the presentation um but you know we&apos;ve seen large Global outages recently with regards to Microsoft we&apos;ve seen previous ones with Facebook and I think if we&apos;re going to build an identity system around um these types of resources we should try and mitigate as much as possible uh single points of failure. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Um thirdly uh a lot of resources that are currently stored um are on kind of centralized Cloud infrastructure so this graph on the left here shows that you know most of what is stored on servers around the world is actually narrowly around 3 or 4 Cloud infrastructure providers um which makes Global outages or systemic outages um a lot more common uh if say a big provider like AWS goes down it could take down a lot of potential system. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Um and then finally there&apos;s this concept of Link rot uh which we talked about a lot which is and I if I go back to the example of the schema analogy which I showed previously we need to make sure that you know if we have a driver&apos;s license which potentially has a lifespan of you know 30 40 years we need to make sure that a schema that was issued 30 40 years ago. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: That the link for that schema doesn&apos;t break you know. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-47').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-47').show()" id="47" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Lot a long way down the track um this diagram on the left here shows that um I can&apos;t remember the date I think it was since the late 90s 47.7% of all links on the internet have now died um and if we don&apos;t look at that as a issue when we&apos;re building these sort of. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Identity credentials with longevity then um we&apos;ll run into similar sort of. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-49').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-49').show()" id="49" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Issues with resolving to these resources going forward. <a id="link-49" style="display:none;" href="#49">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-50').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-50').show()" id="50" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Another issue I think that I touched on slightly earlier is. <a id="link-50" style="display:none;" href="#50">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-51').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-51').show()" id="51" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: We are converging around some I would say more centralized methods I don&apos;t have a problem with this at all but I think we should be mindful of some of the potential implications of this um so with did web specifically you know I think we all most many of us on the call are aware of the challenges of it um but it is also a very simplistic and easy to use div method but yes if if a hosting provider is hacked or goes down um that could potentially affect the system and did TDW you know go some of the way to solve those problems but you know if you can&apos;t access the did log file and you know the historic sort of records of the did itself then you might run into similar challenges as well um but I don&apos;t want to go into detail on the TDW or did web in this call that&apos;s not the point of it um so yeah resources did linked resources uh just to summarize are. <a id="link-51" style="display:none;" href="#51">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-52').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-52').show()" id="52" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Are a way of mitigating some of the risks of this sort of downtime on these critical components of the uh credential and identity ecosystems that we are currently all sort of rapidly uh getting ourselves involved in um. <a id="link-52" style="display:none;" href="#52">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-53').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-53').show()" id="53" class="information">Alex_Tweeddale: Actually going to skip this do this section after. <a id="link-53" style="display:none;" href="#53">✪</a></div>

Topic: <Digital Credentials API>

Harrison_Tang: So welcome uh welcome to this week's ccg meeting 
  so today we're excited to have the team and Sam actually here to 
  present our digital credentials API but before we get to the main 
  agenda I just want to quickly go over some administrative stuff 
  so first of all a quick reminder on the call to pass the exam 
  professional contact I just want to make sure that we hold our 
  respectful and constructive conversations here.
Harrison_Tang: All right next uh a quick note on the intellectual 
  property anyone can participate in these calls however all 
  substantive contributions to any work items must be member of the 
  ccg with full IPR agreement signed so if you have any questions 
  in regards to the w3c account or the IPR agreement uh please feel 
  free to reach out to any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang: Uh a quick note about the call uh these meetings 
  are automatically recorded and transcribed and we will uh publish 
  the transcription the audio recording and the video recording in 
  the next day or 2.
Harrison_Tang: These uh GG chat to cue the speaker so you can 
  type in Q Plus to add yourself to the queue or cue minus and I'll 
  be moderating the queue.
Harrison_Tang: All right next uh just uh want to take a quick 
  moment uh for the introductions and the introductions so I know 
  there's a lot of new faces here uh if anyone's feeling brave uh 
  feel free to just unmute and introduce yourself.
Harrison_Tang: All right I know a lot of people can't wait to get 
  to the main agenda so I'll go to the next.
Harrison_Tang: Next agenda uh announcements and reminders uh 
  anyone have any new announcements or reminders money please.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/Meetings/Minutes/2025-02-26-vcwg#resolution1
Manu Sporny:  Uh yeah just a couple um the first 1 um I'll put 
  the link in the the chat Channel but um for those of you that 
  weren't aware the verifiable credential working group uh resolved 
  to transition I think 7 specifications to uh the proposed 
  recommendation state so this is the the completion of the 
  verifiable credential to a work um a by and large uh we are 
  hoping that the transition happens around March 20th with a full 
  Global standards for all 7 of those specifications happening mid 
  April uh sometime so that's on a good Glide path in the group has 
  basically finished its work on those specifications so that's 
  good news but that of course raises the question of like okay 
  what are we going to work on next um there has been a.
Manu Sporny:  Is now meeting uh on kind of the Next Generation 
  data Integrity stuff I'll put a link uh into the chat Channel.
Manu Sporny:  Um so these are the data Integrity meetings.
<manu_sporny> Data Integrity meetings: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Feb/0056.html
Manu Sporny:  And we are largely focused on privacy preserving uh 
  uh cryptography Suites uh and post-quantum uh Suites there's been 
  quite a number of people uh that are showing up to those meetings 
  so that's good and that's incubating work that will go into the 
  next Charter um there is also other work uh that is being 
  incubated here that we probably need to start having meetings on 
  around uh render method confidence method um uh uh The Selective 
  redaction uh you know crypto sees stuff like that um and so we 
  might send out an invitation to a new meeting series just to 
  finish up incubating that work before we move it on to the bcw so 
  uh again thank you to everyone um on all the great work 
  incubating stuff uh here so that the verifiable credential uh 
  working group can uh finish up uh the work on the standards track 
  uh that's it for me.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man.
Harrison_Tang: Other announcements were reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any updates in regards to the work items.
Harrison_Tang: Family Man are there new developments to the 
  confidence method and branded method that maybe I can invite uh 
  the people to present the latest developments.
Manu Sporny:  No I mean yes and no uh yes uh there's been a lot 
  of movement but no like the various people moving those things 
  forward haven't gotten together to come up with a cohesive 
  narrative so it might in in 2 or 3 months maybe um but but short 
  term probably not I don't know if that answers your question.
Harrison_Tang: That's great thanks.
Will Abramson:  Sure yeah I guess I want to speak to this like 
  it's right like it would be great to kind of Kickstart these 
  efforts I think with confidence method we see like an effort of 
  like like a work item that kind of like like at least in terms of 
  the ccg is stagnated right and I feel like there's not a.
Will Abramson:  An owner of that works currently I think it would 
  be good to like use you know if we're gonna kick up these new 
  streams of work it'd be good to maybe rethink how those streams 
  feed back into this group in a more regular Pace uh.
Will Abramson:   I just.
Will Abramson:  That's the flag for us all to think about how it 
  might help these work items keep um energy.
Harrison_Tang: Just a quick uh reminder so next week we have the 
  uh open meeting with work ID updates and uh quarter 1 2025 review 
  so uh you know for different uh project leads uh please feel uh 
  please uh help us update that deck that I sent out so thanks.
Harrison_Tang: Right any other uh.
Harrison_Tang: Things in regards to announcements reminders work 
  work items.
Harrison_Tang: So a quick note on the on the technical things in 
  regards to this call so uh if uh later uh you know if the 
  presentation got very big and people got kicked out.
Harrison_Tang: For me to just uh refresh the browser and rejoin 
  uh everything should work uh uh you know without any issues uh 
  actually the culture has been looking to uh transferring the call 
  to zoom uh but uh we you know we're still trying to figure out 
  the the details because uh none of the cultures has the admin 
  access to w3c zoom account so we're still trying to figure out 
  how we can do that.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda so uh today 
  we're very excited to have a team in kapali from okta San go from 
  Google and actually Heather uh who cheers the family identity 
  group to talk about digital credentials API um a quick note uh 
  there's a.
Harrison_Tang: Uh Federated credentials management API which is 
  uh more about uh browsers uh you know basically uh you know the 
  original premise is basically uh uh get the browsers uh to 
  support Federated identities and single sign on uh without the 
  cookies third party cookies and digital credentials API.
Harrison_Tang: Actually accessing uh the credentials within a 
  wallet uh so on today's session is mostly about the digital 
  credentials API and I think that can 17 can go into more further 
  details so very excited about this thing because I personally 
  think I think a lot of you guys heard me talking about how I 
  personally think this is actually uh 1 of the biggest 
  opportunities uh to drive market adoption uh for self software 
  identity so thank you uh in advance team and Sam for jump now.
Tim_Cappalli: All right uh just a quick audio check can you hear 
  me.
Tim_Cappalli: Okay awesome um hi everyone uh thanks for having us 
  today um we're gonna present as if you've never heard of the 
  digital credentials API just to to help level set um there's a a 
  lot of history here going back we're almost on year 4 it seems it 
  well it doesn't seem it is year 4 um so we'll go through the 
  background how we got here um kind of where where things are at 
  um some exciting news about how the work will progress and um if 
  we have time at the end we'll wrap up with a little comparison of 
  you know the DC API and fcm um they're they're they're separate 
  but you know some of the um end States uh align closer than many 
  many uh many things so uh we we will talk about that.
Tim_Cappalli: So to start on the background and design goals and 
  feel free to interrupt let's make this a conversation um so feel 
  free to ask questions as we go um I think as as you're all very 
  familiar with right we have kind of 2 generations of problem the 
  first generation was how do you actually present um especially 
  real world identity documents but anything that is in the 
  physical world um to a website right and that really meant um up 
  until recently and Still Remains for many sites holding a 
  document up to a webcam I literally had to do it last night to 
  bootstrap a new device and it's just the most infuriatingly awful 
  experience um and um you know you scan the document you do a live 
  check um most people have to scan it 2 or 3 times because you 
  know you're trying to align to a webcam that is um.
Tim_Cappalli:  why is my.
Tim_Cappalli: Keep going off.
Tim_Cappalli: Speaking of its weird um uh you know you keep 
  having to align it to the to the frame and make sure the mrz is 
  visible and all these fun things No No 1 actually really I I 
  shouldn't say no I hope no 1 actually enjoys this experience but 
  maybe there's someone out there um so then then came right 
  verifiable digital credentials and and being able to present them 
  on the web but that meant Uh custom schemes and QR codes right 
  that's kind of been the status quo um for a number of years now 
  um which have very poor security properties and a and a pretty 
  bad user experience as well um so we've made some progress on the 
  digital format of these documents but um the presentation got 
  slightly better but with a lot of room to improve um so custom 
  schemes you know these are just a I assume everyone knows what 
  they are these are a few that are out there um they're 
  unpredictable they're not standardized um they lead to very poor 
  experiences here's a few um this is actually even at a date I 
  went and found this list um last July so I'm sure there's more if 
  you notice right people keep just adding to the left or the 
  right.
Tim_Cappalli:  right to make them more specific.
Tim_Cappalli: Try to have a more predictable experience um but 
  you know you're just continuing to Kick the Can um and waiting 
  for things to break again.
Tim_Cappalli: So some of the challenges with custom schemes um 
  right that you you can invoke invoke them from an insecure 
  context right that could be a page served over hdb um it could be 
  an app using an insecure channel right there's there's no binding 
  to an actual um a a secure context whether it's on the web or on 
  the app platform you can actually fish users via app selection 
  right so we move you know we have fishing on the web largely 
  solve for authentication but now we have like this app fishing 
  problem um because you know any app can can register and claim uh 
  uh to to to be the uh request of this um if you notice in the 
  screenshot this is just a mockup right it does use the normal 
  Android uh disambiguation UI but I kind of added some wallets 
  there in Photoshop so doesn't look exactly like this but it 
  probably should look familiar you'll notice there's like no 
  request or or identity right who who actually is making this 
  request it's just asking me to complete an action I have no idea 
  who actually asked for this.
Tim_Cappalli: I mentioned at the beginning it's not standardized 
  right there's no it's actually very hard to find a formal 
  definition for custom schemes because it's just kind of something 
  that's always existed um and you know continues to cause issues.
Tim_Cappalli: Know you know there's a context switch for the user 
  right so when I tap on a link in a in a in a website or in a 
  service you know it just kind of takes you out of out of that 
  context right usually it takes you to the other app after you 
  select it and there's actually no real easy way to fall back from 
  that if there's an error both success and error right so once I 
  pick an app on the screen go to the app like you really can't get 
  back easily and there's not a great way to share State as well.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh and the last big 1 which I think should be very 
  clear from this screen this this uh screenshot right it's a very 
  very poor ux for credential selection right you users don't 
  understand wallet selection right they don't even know what a 
  wallet is write a wallet is just an app um and so asking user to 
  make a decision based on this information is just is just you 
  know not not realistic for most users.
Tim_Cappalli: Um so a lot of this work kind of took the learnings 
  from pass keys right as we rolled out pass keys I Was A New 
  Concept for users you know web authentic Pho have been around 
  forever but it was really in the work context there wasn't a ton 
  of um usage outside of the workplace um and so you know users 
  think users don't think about their authenticators right 
  authenticator being their security key or or bit Warden or Google 
  password manager right they don't think about that they think 
  about the account or the credential itself right like like a user 
  does not necessarily know where they store each individual thing 
  maybe they say oh I store most of my stuff in 1 passwords.
Tim_Cappalli: Apple password right like you don't think that way 
  they think about the account they're trying to access or the 
  individual credential.
Tim_Cappalli: And the other piece is call our context right as I 
  mentioned with in the previous uh screenshot there there's no 
  context there this you know with a when you use a pass key it's 
  very clear who is asking right it's a website or an app named 
  that's very clearly presented um and the last 1 is that cross 
  device right so being able to present from my phone which is 
  where a majority of wallets in the near-term are going to exist 
  uh to your desktop to access a service in a browser or in the 
  native app platform that has to be easy to use and it has to be 
  secure and resistant to phishing right and that's another thing 
  that came from.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh the pass Keys effort right is we solve that 
  cross device uh flow with a you know it's not as it's not as easy 
  to use as obviously if the credentials on your local device but 
  we think it's a it's a good experience for those fall back 
  scenarios where you don't have a credential on local device and 
  it's secure and resistant efficient.
Tim_Cappalli: So as this work started um there's some Core Design 
  principles that were uh you know agreed upon in the group that um 
  you know is the ycg and some IBEW sessions and other things um to 
  kind of figure out where these boundaries are between what a web 
  API would look like and kind of the rest of the ecosystem and the 
  4 um I would say most critical design principles were separating 
  the active requesting um the specific protocol um to allow for 
  flexibility in Pro protocol and credential formats right so um 
  browsers can evolve protocols can evolve and they won't 
  necessarily block each other right that was a very very very 
  early very loud and clear request from The Wider community of of 
  of of how to build this in in a way that was extensible and and 
  non-blocking.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh the other 1 is require request transparency 
  right so the you the browser is the user's agent where you know 
  this is a w3c call I think I think we're all very aware of that 
  um and the browser needs to do as much as I can to protect users 
  from risk um so having the requests that's passed into the API uh 
  be be visible to the to the browser to potentially put up a speed 
  bump saying are you sure even um is is really important but 
  assume that the response right so the the presentation is 
  encrypted um to the verifier right um so that um allows the 
  verifiers and the holders to control when pii is is exposed so 
  request unencrypted response encrypted that's the Assumption you 
  don't have to uh encrypt the response if you don't want to but 
  that's kind of the design assumption.
Tim_Cappalli: Um and the last 1 similar to um web authent and 
  pass Keys uh present web present a website.
Tim_Cappalli: Prevent a website from silently querying for the 
  availability of credentials um and communicating with credential 
  providers without explicit consent right so that's a similar 
  Paradigm um in the web authn world right you can't just probe to 
  see if there's an authenticator uh a specific authenticator or a 
  specific credential available um that's just a pretty big 
  fingerprinting service.
Tim_Cappalli: Any questions before I move on here.
<?> an array of these things...
Tim_Cappalli: All right so in terms of how the the the the the 
  layers all interact here right in the different components um 
  with the digital credentials API to the left um the API itself as 
  we'll see in a minute is very very simple right uh it takes in a 
  protocol um and a protocol string uh and a request object um and 
  so the 2 protocols that are are are used today um and you know 
  we've been working between the different communities that Define 
  these protocols our open ID for VP for presentation and open ID 
  for VCI for credential issuance so the API can take in and oid 
  for VP or VCI request object um and inside of that you know if we 
  keep going down um there it's also credential formatting agnostic 
  right so you can use open ID for VP with ISO endoc or open ID for 
  VP with SD chop VC the API itself is agnostic to all of that 
  right it just needs to know the protocol string and a request 
  object.
Tim_Cappalli:  um you'll.
Tim_Cappalli: At the bottom it's open.
Tim_Cappalli: For others right this is designed to be extensible 
  the the spec has a registry um and 1 of the things I'll talk 
  about later is how do we actually get new uh entries into the 
  into the registry.
Tim_Cappalli: All right I see some questions sorry the 
  transcription thing is very distracting.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh who is first.
Tim_Cappalli: Oh you are oh okay sorry I thought I saw a question 
  um.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh Sam and Sam just chime in more um.
Tim_Cappalli:  in terms.
Tim_Cappalli: Of real responsibilities this comes up um a lot and 
  I'm going to turn my camera off so you can see the bottom because 
  I think it's.
Tim_Cappalli: Um there there's essentially in in this here right 
  there's 3 there's the browser the OS platform and the credential 
  provider and obviously the user is off to the side but from a 
  from the the technology stack standpoint um and wants to talk 
  about kind of the roles and responsibilities of each of these and 
  what is not is and is not in scope for each of these right so the 
  browser operating on the web as the web platform obviously 
  provides the API service to developers does some basic request 
  validation right like you need to build an error out if you if 
  the developer sends in a bad request uh it does all of the 
  existing secure context checks that happen um with other apis 
  right like in web and you can't can only call Webb off and in a 
  secure context same thing here that also allows for providing the 
  origin because the you know TLS authentication is a server 
  authentication has a curve with the origin um again very very 
  similar to web authn um and the browser also handles the 
  interaction with the underlying OS platform right so to talk cell 
  phone into the platform the browser needs to know how to 
  communicate itself though.
Tim_Cappalli: On the OS platform.
Tim_Cappalli: Side um the OS platform is responsible for a 
  credential selector for presentation and a provider selector for 
  issuance right that that's where the big differences between 
  presentation versus issuance during presentation um there's a 
  little bit more intelligence right there's you know parties can 
  work together to to to uh provide more context to the user 
  whereas during issuance very similar to pass Keys you you have to 
  ask the user where they want to put it right that there's not not 
  a whole lot of other ways around that um so that's the you know 
  slight difference between the presentation experience and 
  issuance experience the OS platform also handles cross device 
  transport um so actually getting the getting the presentation 
  from my phone to uh let's say browser on my laptop.
Tim_Cappalli: And the OS platform also handles native app 
  requests right so um similar to the web authn API there is a um.
Tim_Cappalli: A native app abstraction um of the API on the app 
  platform.
Tim_Cappalli: Happens to on Android for example mirror I think 
  it's actually identical um the web platform API off of cred man 
  um and that allows a native app to also uh do a presentation or 
  issue and request uh through a similar API.
Tim_Cappalli: The 1 thing that's common between the browser and 
  the OS platform is a permission check you know we're explicitly 
  saying permission not consent write permission to continue and 
  disclose the request to the next party right so I I'll show a 
  screenshot in a minute there's a clear line between where the 
  wallet gets notified of the requests because even just a request 
  can be privacy invasive um for the user especially if you phone 
  home and tell others about it um so the permission we're 
  explicitly using the term permission um whereas the wallet or the 
  credential provider is what is in charge of holder consent very 
  you know 2 different pieces there.
Tim_Cappalli: The other things that the credential provider 
  handles which I'm sure you all know holder verification right 
  Biometrics pin all of the presentation and issuance protocols get 
  implemented in that uh application so that in clarifier and RP 
  authentication selector disclosure signing encryption all that 
  fun stuff and then Key Management right so a majority of the the 
  things are still left up to the credential provider.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry a couple uh questions uh first of all a 
  quick clarification question is that for digital credentials API 
  does it has to go does that.
Harrison_Tang:  have to.
Harrison_Tang: Go through the browser or can can the an app just 
  interact with the app Wallet through the OS.
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah so so um like like like with web authn right 
  like the the w3c digital credentials API right once it gets that 
  status is the web platform definition of it which is often 
  mirrored into the app platform that's not required obviously 
  there is there's no standards beliefs for the app platform um but 
  it happens to be that the current implementations that are out 
  there mirror the web platform API 1 to 1 so you can make the same 
  requests to the OS natively if you're a native app as you would 
  to uh through the web as a web verifier.
Harrison_Tang: Money the next thank you.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah thanks Tim this is great uh as always uh 
  really appreciate the like um uh really clear narrative on on uh 
  you know kind of what what's going on here I'm I'm looking I'm 
  wondering what the latest is on uh kind of the OS uh in uh 
  browser platforms is there is there full agreement at this point 
  about these being the roles and responsibilities and there being 
  like true uh you know app Wallet selection or or there any rough 
  edges left there or do we feel like you know Apple and Google uh 
  and the Samsung effectively agree that um these are kind of the 
  foundational parts of the.
Manu Sporny:  The the roles and responsibilities for the OS and 
  browser platforms.
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah I I don't want to speak for any of those 
  companies but there has not been negative uh no nothing negative 
  is brought up about this architecture right so we you know if you 
  you can actually see some of the um you know the the browser 
  engine code for some other platforms and maybe have not announced 
  announced support yet um and it very much mirrors this web 
  whether they call it for example a selector or like the 
  terminology obviously it might be slightly different um but the 
  concepts do seem to line up and Sam might have something to say 
  here as well.
Harrison_Tang: Send you have something to add.
Harrison_Tang: Money do you have a follow-up question I know we 
  go go to dimitry.
Manu Sporny:  A follow-up statement because I don't want to put 
  Tim and Sam on the spot so I'll just make a statement you know I 
  I think that's that's great that you know regulation is playing a 
  part in um how this is deployed I think this actually gives us a 
  path forward to True uh kind of uh wallet and app selection um I 
  am wondering out loud um uh how these apis might be implemented 
  in uh countries where that regulation doesn't exist so for 
  example uh what we could see is that you know the European Union 
  does have true app selection but for example the US ends up not 
  having it because the regulations uh weaker um in in the states 
  so uh again not asking for anyone's opinion on that just 
  highlighting that as you know potential outcome I think the work 
  that's being done here is just really fantastic and great and is 
  the closest we've gotten to you know true true wallet and apps 
  selection uh ever thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Question about the affordances of the mobile 
  API as far as identifying the request origin to the user right so 
  for the web we have the the actual domain origin so we can say 
  website.com is requesting a credential what's the affordances for 
  the apps are we able to identify is the OS able to identify the 
  apps I mean presumably yes and how does it um how does that 
  identify the app to the requester.
Tim_Cappalli: Sam I believe it's the same as what about then 
  right where it's an APK hash of the binary.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And does does it present the the name to the 
  to the US.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sir okay got it.
Tim_Cappalli: The UI definitely shows the name um but I believe 
  like the origin that's passed to the like in the API let don't 
  quote me on this I will follow up but I believe it's going to be 
  the APK hash just like web authn on Android and I assume given.
Tim_Cappalli: Apple platforms don't use APK hash they map it to a 
  web origin I I would assume that would be the pattern they would 
  follow but I can't speak for them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Got it thank you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yes the requesters the the relying parties.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right yeah so I was curious about the mobile 
  side.
Tim_Cappalli: I'll I'll get an interview by the end of the call 
  I'm pretty sure it's going to be the APK hash like what.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you so much.
Andy Miller:  Yeah thanks the um was it something that I'm not 
  sure about from here is the verifier does the verifier get a 
  sense of the wallet.
Andy Miller:  Uh the wallets I did I I use identity Loosely here 
  there may be another term for it but like well the the verifier 
  need to know the wallet in these like in web authentic it's not 
  really that important what the provider's identity is we've been 
  able to move past that but what is that like here in the DC.
Andy Miller:  Okay so if that's a protocol.
Tim_Cappalli: Right I mean the only the only.
<zacharias_törnblom_third_attempt> EUDI when using digital 
  credentials api will require specific wallets
Andy Miller:  Okay so that could that would be orchestrated 
  through the protocol as opposed to and and DC API has no 
  influence because DC API is basically a funnel for the verifier 
  to talk to the wallet okay.
Andy Miller:  And turning over.
Andy Miller:  Yeah that makes sense that that comes down to the 
  choice of protocol used over the DC API and whether or not that 
  allows the verifier to know the holder's identity.
Andy Miller:  Okay thank you very much.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh Demetri I already got an answer yes it's on 
  Android it's the APK hash just like used with web authent.
<dmitri_zagidulin> thanks
Tim_Cappalli: Is that all.
Harrison_Tang: All right I don't think and yep that's everyone.
Tim_Cappalli: All right all right so let's continue on um uh you 
  may have seen this diagram before I I reuse it a lot um in terms 
  of the protocols we're talking about right so the digital 
  credentials API uh operates in the browser context right so 
  that's this uh stop sign looking box um the other standardized 
  protocol that is in use with this whole experience is um reusing 
  actually the phyto cap 22 protocol um which actually was modified 
  to it it 22 started with uh adding support for cros device uh 
  with pass Keys uh and we also modified it um late last year to 
  support uh a digital credentials request as well um so um anyone 
  any platforms that support uh ctap 222 uh once it you know it's 
  it's actually a final now the board approved it um they will just 
  need a quick update to support the DC API uh and now they can do 
  cross device uh presentation as well um so those are the 2 you 
  know the the blue line and the or the middle line I should say 
  and then the the lines coming off the verifier.
Tim_Cappalli: You know standards based protocols and then the 
  purple lines are ultimately the app app platform abstractions 
  that exists um to to to support the individual um apis on the OS.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh these these diagrams uh I'll I'll put a link I 
  thought I had on the slide but you can find these in the DC API 
  repo um it just kind of goes through like who is involved what is 
  happening what apis are used so in this example um this is a same 
  device scenario with a web-based verifier and a native app wallet 
  so the verifier can you see my mouse.
Tim_Cappalli:  it's hard for.
Tim_Cappalli: Okay sorry um so so in this case right the the 
  browser renders the verifier site most likely gets a bunch of 
  parameters from the back end um to to craft the presentation 
  request the presentation request is passed into the digital 
  credentials API the browser then may decide to show a quick 
  prompt asking the user for confirmation um but typically it's 
  going to then hand it off uh to the the app platform apis at this 
  point um this is where the selection screen will pop up and I 
  realize as I'm presenting we have actually shown that yet um but 
  there'll be a pop-up that says hey you know these are the 
  credentials we think you may want to present and here's what's 
  being asked for and once the user hits continue on that line 4 it 
  gets dispatched off to the the the wallet app the credential 
  provider it does whatever it needs to it could just be a 
  biometric check it it's probably going to be consent it may even 
  be other things after the user has um allowed the wallet to take 
  over the wallet can do anything um and then it you know uh 
  packages up the response.
Tim_Cappalli:  and sends it.
Tim_Cappalli: Back through that API.
Tim_Cappalli: Call which then makes its way back up to the 
  browser um in that response from via the platform API and then 
  the digital credentials API promise resolves with the result of 
  the presentation um for issuance it would be um a slightly 
  different um but the the very very uh similar.
Tim_Cappalli: And then the cross device flow everything is 
  largely the same except to get from device a to device B um we 
  use uh the phyto protocol to get the request over there and then 
  the same component on the other device handles getting it to the 
  wallet app it comes back response goes back over the uh C the the 
  channel here and then goes back up to the verifier so very very 
  similar just another protocol sitting in the middle to handle 
  cross device.
Tim_Cappalli: And like I said there's a bunch of these diagrams 
  uh including uh native to Native uh that I'll link to at the end.
Tim_Cappalli: In terms of the API I mentioned at the beginning it 
  is it is very very basic right the the the API itself like the 
  interface is very very basic um it hangs off um credential 
  management just like uh web off end just like uh fedsmith um 
  object which takes um a protocol and a and a data parameter right 
  so the protocol is ultimately going to be mapped in the spec as a 
  in the registry right and that protocol identifier is mapped to a 
  specification right so the registry is is is inactive work area 
  where we're working on in the spec text but ultimately the goal 
  is to map um this type of request to a a specification somewhere 
  else right uh and today that is open ID for VP that lives in open 
  ID so the registry entry for this will say you know this string 
  here open ID for VP V1 unsigned uh and it will point to a link to 
  the other protocol and inside data right the term data is very 
  generic by Design it's an object that takes.
Tim_Cappalli: Request um and and that is defined by the protocol 
  right so that is not defined in the digital credentials API is 
  defined in the protocol and that's what the registry maps to.
Tim_Cappalli: So you can imagine in this request I didn't put it 
  here because it would be too small uh we're requesting family 
  name given name and an age predicate um so all of the different 
  open ID for VP parameters that would enable that would be passed 
  and then you get the selection screen at the platform layer.
Tim_Cappalli: Um so so coming up a little bit full circle on the 
  problem statements we had right so in a presentation flow right 
  we were missing who is asking uh we're missing what they were 
  asking for um and we didn't really get any context other than the 
  provider name before so now we have that right so this is the 
  selector screen rendered by the OS um we are asking to if we can 
  share our credentials with digital credentials Dev that's the 
  origin um they are asking for a family name given name and an age 
  predicate over 21 um and we have a very credential Centric view 
  right it does say who can actually provide the credential in this 
  case the wallet name is IC wallet but that's a very very small 
  piece of of of the selection screen for the user right it's very 
  credential Centric I do have a credential it's called Tim's 
  driving license that can be these requirements and this is the 
  info that will be shared um and as I mentioned uh earlier this is 
  the example where the the wallet hasn't learned anything yet 
  right so this is being rendered by the OS platform in a sandbox 
  um and this sandbox.
Tim_Cappalli: Provided by the wallet that runs uh essentially a 
  matcher right and so by being in a sandbox um you you can't make 
  any network calls for example right so by being able by rendering 
  the selector you're still not able to let's say collude or send 
  information to your back end um that could be used for like 
  information gathering or or tracking a user right so uh until the 
  user clicks continue here the wallet knows nothing the wallet is 
  just essentially said to the OS hey here's all my matching code 
  uh run the request against it um and anyone any wallet that can 
  handle this request will then show up in the selector once the 
  user is has again permission once permission has been granted uh 
  by clicking continue now that's completely dispatched off to the 
  wallet and the wallet is responsible for everything else 
  including uh holder consent right so that's that's kind of the 
  dividing line we have to probably find a better way to visualize 
  this um with some new pictures but um that's that's really the 
  key dividing line um and you know the browser is.
Tim_Cappalli:  largely out of.
Tim_Cappalli: The picture it's holding a.
Tim_Cappalli: Right like its it hasn't resolved the promise yet 
  um it's just sitting there waiting for a response.
Tim_Cappalli: All right uh just to show you this for real um.
Tim_Cappalli: You've already seen this elsewhere but I'll do a 
  quick demo um.
Tim_Cappalli: My phone ready here.
Tim_Cappalli: Can you still see my screen.
<bumblefudge> i think that's a jitsi resource thing
Tim_Cappalli: Okay those those were the dropped okay uh you can 
  see my phone screen on top yep okay cool all right uh so real 
  quick we'll do a demo just on on this device right this is just a 
  normal there's nothing special about this device Android 15 
  Chrome 135 I assume at this point um and in this case this is a 
  public demo site I'm going to request family name give it name 
  and age over 21 and I actually have a wallet installed it's the 
  oh open Wallet Foundation actually sorry this is um going to use 
  CM wallet sorry I have so many Wallets on here this is just a 
  sample wallet for the digital credentials API and in here I have 
  a driving license sorry the UI is a little it's just for demo but 
  I have a driving license for John Smith and an age predicate um 
  and that is in my CM wallet and you'll notice I have other 
  wallets installed um to show that you know only the wallet that 
  has a credential that can match will show up and I'm going to go 
  ahead and click request credentials now this is actually a chrome 
  right this is this is an example of the browser optionally 
  requesting permission.
Tim_Cappalli:  right this may not always.
<kayode_ezike> I may have missed this, but how does a wallet 
  register with the DC API, so that it appears in the wallet 
  selector?
Tim_Cappalli: Right it may be that yeah this is determined to be 
  a high-value you know it's an Isom doc right so with a um.
Tim_Cappalli: Mobile driving license right so this this may or 
  may not show up it's the user agents Choice based on risk uh to 
  the user um but this is a very basic 1 that's just saying hey 
  like.
<kim_duffy> Can you decline?
Tim_Cappalli: We're we're about to ask you for some information 
  so I'm going to click continue and in this case now the OS 
  selector screen right so this is actually the mattress code is 
  already run um and the CM wallet has responded back and said I 
  can handle this request I have John's driving license um and it's 
  asking are you you know you're going to be asked to share family 
  name given name and age over 21 so I'm okay with that um if there 
  were actually 2s here you'll see very very small at the bottom 
  here there's a little dot you would actually see like a rotating 
  like a cart selection um so that you could you could pick a 
  different 1 in this case I only have 1 uh I saw in the chat can 
  you decline yep I can just click off of it and now I'm done but 
  again that's just a bad error for demo but um you can decline it 
  yes and I'm going to restart it.
Tim_Cappalli: And I'm going to click continue.
Harrison_Tang: By the way 10 there's also another question in the 
  chat which is uh you know how does the wallet register with the 
  DC API and uh so that it appears in the wallet selector.
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah I I'll answer that right let me just finish 
  the demo and then I'll answer that um so in this case I'm going 
  to go ahead and click continue in this case the wallet doesn't 
  need anything other than a biometric consent likely to do the 
  signing operation but you could show full UI here you could ask 
  the user to do something um you you're likely going to ask for 
  consent but in this demo it's just saying hey uh confirm your 
  identity so in this case I'm going to do my fingerprint and now 
  uh the promise resolves and the browser has gotten the 3 uh 
  claims that were requested um and if you look in debug you'll see 
  there was only 1 document um sent back in this case I didn't 
  check the request encryption um option so it was not encrypted by 
  the wallet um but if I did use encryption you could do that we 
  expect most um government uh identity uh responses to be 
  encrypted.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh to answer the question about the how does the 
  wallet register the OS so you essentially you write your matcher 
  code right and that matcher code anytime the wallet gets a new 
  credential uh so like an issuance process uh fit completes you're 
  most likely going to update your metric code on the Fly and and 
  there's a platform API you call to to essentially push your new 
  mattress to the OS it's a little more detailed than that but 
  that's the high level explanation of how it works.
<kayode_ezike> OK, thanks
<?> wait, request encryption ?
<kim_duffy> Can you share the full payload that gets sent?
Tim_Cappalli: Uh so now let real quick I will do a cross device 
  demo.
Tim_Cappalli: So same site let's see same site that I accessed on 
  the phone.
Tim_Cappalli: And I'm just going to refresh so it's the same 
  request here so requests credentials same prompt you'll notice um 
  and in this case since I don't have a local wallet it's a it's a 
  desktop uh makes sense I'm going to get uh a QR code this is the 
  cross device presentation flow I'm just going to scan it ignore 
  the used Pass key that will get updated eventually um this is all 
  still uh prega so uh it'll eventually say um I think it's gonna 
  say present to credential or choose an ID uh TBD um I'm going to 
  click continue now we're doing the standard cross device uh flow 
  enabled by ctap 222 and you'll see the exact same selection 
  screen that I got locally because the exact same thing is running 
  on the device right so the match the matcher was called the 
  request came into the OS the OS passed it off to the matcher um 
  and this case I'm going to click continue I'm going to do the 
  exact same thing as before the wallet uh returns to the OS and 
  the OS responds back over the cross device connection and back 
  and away we go to the verifier.
Tim_Cappalli: So that all work this is all actually you can play 
  with this um.
Tim_Cappalli: We are working on getting uh digital credentials 
  Dev no dash um updated with some of the newer stuff um you know 
  that will be kind of the develop resource um but this is all 
  there's nothing special about anything um I just showed these are 
  all production builds um of everything.
Tim_Cappalli: I think I saw another question come in as I was uh 
  yeah sorry the request encryption that was a bad way to say that 
  um requesting encryption in the uh here sorry that was a terrible 
  way to say that so right here you'll see using encryption that's 
  what I meant sorry requesting response encryption terrible way to 
  say it.
<?> got it, thx
Tim_Cappalli: Um can you share the payload that gets.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh I don't know if I have 1 here but yeah I I can 
  it's it's it's in this case it would be the open ID for VP 
  response right and and it would be data and then the protocol so 
  it looks almost identical to.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh sorry looks almost identical to this but um data 
  will contain the response.
Harrison_Tang: Kim you have a question.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah I guess I am interested in seeing specifics 
  like you know of course the um.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Potential for linkability things like that um 
  just curious to see what is uh what's what's disclosed.
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah so that all most of that is handled by the 
  protocol itself right so the the API is just carrying the 
  presentation response from open ID for VP.
Tim_Cappalli: Let me see I I can't remember if we log into 
  console let me do it 1 more time and I will see if it's shows it 
  here.
Tim_Cappalli: If you want to keep going with questions while I'm 
  doing this I can answer and.
Harrison_Tang: Demetri you have a question.
<zacharias_törnblom_third_attempt> How much information is 
  available to the device/os in the various steps of the 
  request/response?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think the question many of us was mind is we 
  have a chance to demo the the other flow the provisioning the 
  issues flow uh because this is fantastic like I'm I'm super 
  excited about this flow of requesting credentials I'm curious if 
  there's any uh good news on the issue.
Tim_Cappalli: Um yeah I will talk about that in a second I do not 
  have a demo but I can send a video of it um after and I'll cover 
  it just a second um I think it was Kim Kim here's here's 
  essentially the response so in the protocol um member it's it's 
  the string this is an old old name um we're we're in the midst of 
  like normalizing everything uh and then the data uh contains the 
  VB token.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Okay thank you I screen captured so I can I can 
  start playing with it thanks.
Tim_Cappalli: Um okay and I promise I will come back to issue 
  once it's in here um and I'll talk about in a second um.
Tim_Cappalli: Check 10 minutes yeah got.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry Tim there's 1 more question uh from Zachary 
  is uh it's a how much information is available to the device and 
  Os in the various step of the request response.
Tim_Cappalli: Uh so the browser passes the raw request that's 
  passed into the digital credentials API to the matter um and the 
  output of the the wallet right the encrypted response and the 
  request is sent back right so that's those are the only 2 inputs 
  and outputs.
Harrison_Tang: Cool hopefully that this answers your question.
Harrison_Tang: Alright thanks uh please proceed thanks.
Tim_Cappalli: Okay cool I'm gonna run a little quicker through 
  this because we only have about 10 minutes but just kind of where 
  we're at the most exciting that the most important thing from the 
  slide is um we are hoping to migrate this work to the Federate 
  identity working group uh in April um when we have a face-to-face 
  right obviously the both groups need to agree that that's the 
  right uh time and and agree that it's a good idea but we're 
  fairly optimistic that that will happen which is great um because 
  we've been in the ycg for a long time um and we hope to get a 
  first public working draft out by June um which I think would 
  make a lot of people around the world very happy to to see some 
  more formality around this so long long way long way from uh the 
  phyto wallet task force which I think some of you were involved 
  in in 2021 um but we're we're finally there.
<sam_goto> we call it a devtrial
<aaron> may be interesting to think about what a malicious 
  matcher could do
<bumblefudge> ^^^^^
Tim_Cappalli: Current major work items so here you go Demetri um 
  so the first 1 is defining issuance um so Google does have a um I 
  guess it's beyond a prototype at this point um but issuance 
  working and like I said I can send a video I'll find a way to 
  share it um that Lee showed uh last week in the at a payments 
  event um that that shows issuance uh and again that uses today 
  open ID for VCI but you know Dev trial thank you so um but um you 
  know other protocols could be added to the registry um we are 
  also working on uh defining how to actually get into the registry 
  right so there needs to be some agreed upon rules in the spec 
  that says you know here's the minimum security bar for a protocol 
  that's going to be added to the registry Etc that's 1 example.
<sam_goto> yeah, that comes up a lot. it is safer to do on 
  android because there is the play store policies, but harder on 
  the open web.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I think the matcher VM is very tightly 
  sandboxed
<sam_goto> yeah, information doesn't escape in or out, but it can 
  still lie
Tim_Cappalli: Um and as I mentioned uh the migration to the 
  Federate identity working group um that has a little bit of 
  process behind it right we need to come up with a list of um 
  blocking issues um issue we we want to get issuance in there for 
  example before we move it um and that is a um that PR is actually 
  in in Flight uh and is undergoing feedback already um so we're 
  pretty pretty confident that will happen so those are the 3 Big 
  Work items that you know day-to-day working on um async and in 
  the call.
<sam_goto> e.g. say and intercept that it has a mobile drivers 
  license
Tim_Cappalli: And before I do this slide because this this could 
  uh turn into a big discussion um did that enter your uh your 
  issuance question Demetri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Side uh it does but broadly speaking is is the 
  idea that the OS pops up a an app selection diagram or not 
  diagram uh dialogue.
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah so yeah so instead of instead of a credential 
  picker it'll be like a a wallet picker yep.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And there's corresponding matcher uh 
  affordances that says I'm ready to accept such and such 
  credential.
Tim_Cappalli: I believe that is the same pattern why.
Tim_Cappalli: All right um so the last thing um and then we'll I 
  guess we'll probably end up with 5 minutes for questions you know 
  the question keeps coming up right the DC API versus fcm like 
  they're they're both hang off cred man um you know digital 
  verifiable digital credentials are arguably just a new way to do 
  Federation uh and fed CM kind of started its life as as working 
  with Federation protocols um so like what are the differences 
  right and before we say that maybe I'll start with the 
  commonality right they're both protocol agnostic right fed CM 
  doesn't say You must use open ID connect ID tokens it happens to 
  be that's what most people are using it for but there's nothing 
  in the spec that says You must um same thing with the DC API it's 
  it's protocol agnostic and uh the and also credential agnostic 
  even you know 1 layer removed from credential agnostic um they're 
  both Federation Centric right again like they're they're they're 
  they're they're largely um.
Tim_Cappalli:  coming to.
Tim_Cappalli: At the end of the.
Tim_Cappalli: Flow right you're passing claims from um an issuer 
  whether that's in real time or or at a future point right you're 
  you're you're taking a a set of claims that someone uh said about 
  you or gave to you and passing them off to another party um both 
  of them avoid redirecting custom schemes right so redirects are 
  very heavily used and the Federation world with things like open 
  ID connect um with fzm um you don't need redirects um and with 
  the DC API there's no Redux in the first place.
Tim_Cappalli:  uh and.
Tim_Cappalli: I mentioned they.
Tim_Cappalli: Whole thing off credit man so a lot lot in common 
  um 1 of the big differences right is fed CM operates in what I 
  would say same context same device right so fed CM operates in a 
  browser context um that context is not necessarily shared outside 
  of the browser um right so so if you were going between 2 browers 
  you wouldn't necessarily be able to take a response uh given 
  through browser 1 to browser 2 Laurene um in the DC API right you 
  are since the browser is not directly um the holder of this 
  assertion right you can pass it to whoever whoever you choose as 
  the user right so it operates in a cross context uh on the FED 
  Zam side for device wise write that 1 contextos.
Tim_Cappalli: And in terms of protocols that are typically used 
  again they're both protocol agnostic but the ones that have been 
  seen in kind of these early few years of usage typically fed cm 
  is using open ID connect um and typically the DC API is using 
  open ID for BP for presentation.
Tim_Cappalli: And God damn say say say some stuff.
<aaron> feels like Android Intents for the DOM
<aaron> DC and FED CM are just diffrent Intents and there could 
  be more
Harrison_Tang: Money in it.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah and and and thanks for that same I think the 
  perennial question is um uh are these circles going to end up 
  basically overlapping completely from a use case perspective 
  right I mean I think there's been argument that like oh they're 
  different and and you know all that kind of stuff but if we look 
  at convergence over the long term and I'm talking like 10 to 20 
  years versus like the next 3 um developers are probably not going 
  to want to support both it's just you know complex and things 
  like that and I think it's been put forward that the DC API could 
  potentially uh address all of the uh use cases that the FED CM 
  you know API uh would would um cover have have we seen I I know 
  that this kind of is a debate that's been raging and and frankly 
  I don't know if we really need to have a debate over it because I 
  think there's it's either going to happen or it's not right um 
  and they're kind of natural pressures on on developers to to to.
<harrison_tang> I think in DC, the holder/wallet is in control.  
  In the current FedCM, IDP is in control.  That's another big 
  difference.
Manu Sporny:  Right list code and and converge if it's if it's 
  possible so have there been any breakthroughs lately on that 
  question or is it still kind of a debate that's probably never 
  ending and it's going to keep going on for years.
<kim_duffy> Curious to hear about plans to address Brave 
  objections before we run out of time
Tim_Cappalli: Yeah I mean but 1 thing I would add right um.
Geun-Hyung Kim: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-review-comments/2024Sep/0017.html
<bumblefudge> ^^
Tim_Cappalli: Fed ZM is also has some really awesome use cases 
  for Workforce and Enterprise where a lot of the Privacy 
  preserving properties of of vdcs are actually not desired um 
  right telling the IDP where you sign in is actually a feature not 
  a bug um so that's an example of somewhere where I I I don't 
  think I don't think you're going to be signing in to work 
  resources on a regular basis with a VDC right it doesn't 
  ergonomically doesn't make a lot of sense for users um and also 
  you lose a lot of the visibility which is there by Design um so 
  that's another area I think they will split off.
Harrison_Tang: All right so 1 1 last question this is from Ken uh 
  she's curious to hear about the addressing Brave objections.
Harrison_Tang: I think that that objection has been overturned 
  right so.
Tim_Cappalli: It is I I mean I'm I would recommend just reading 
  the.
<dmitri_zagidulin> what WAS the objction?
Tim_Cappalli: The statement from the group uh I'm not not sure I 
  have a lot to add there personally.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-review-comments/2024Sep/0017.html 
  [scribe assist by Geun-Hyung Kim]
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Kim - thanks!
Wendy_Seltzer_(she/her): Uh just get as the 1 of the working 
  group co-chairs um echoing Tim's statement there the the council 
  was asked to to review the the formal objection and uh overturned 
  it um but said that the the group should continue to uh consider 
  the questions raised and so as the the API comes forward uh in 
  the working group um we will continue to to address privacy uh 
  and other concerns raised by uh any participant.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Thank you yeah just want to make sure that the 
  objections.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah I just want to make sure that those remain 
  top of mind and that the group does intend to follow up on that.
<dmitri_zagidulin> thanks Tim and Sam!!!
Harrison_Tang: Great uh I think we're at time and uh big thanks 
  Tim and Sam for jumping on and actually need this discussion this 
  is a great great session so and great works so thank you.
Tim_Cappalli: Thank you what's the best way for me to get you 
  this deck just email.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah just email me and or you can just reply to 
  the public threat or I can do it for you yeah thanks.
<zacharias_törnblom_third_attempt> and the recording can be found 
  where?
Harrison_Tang: Right this concludes this week's ccg meeting 
  thanks a lot.
<harrison_tang> I will email out the recording to the public CCG 
  list in a day or two

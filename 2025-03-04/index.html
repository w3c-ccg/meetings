<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Okay awesome um hi everyone uh thanks for having us today um we&apos;re gonna present as if you&apos;ve never heard of the digital credentials API just to to help level set um there&apos;s a a lot of history here going back we&apos;re almost on year 4 it seems it well it doesn&apos;t seem it is year 4 um so we&apos;ll go through the background how we got here um kind of where where things are at um some exciting news about how the work will progress and um if we have time at the end we&apos;ll wrap up with a little comparison of you know the DC API and fcm um they&apos;re they&apos;re they&apos;re separate but you know some of the um end States uh align closer than many many uh many things so uh we we will talk about that. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: So to start on the background and design goals and feel free to interrupt let&apos;s make this a conversation um so feel free to ask questions as we go um I think as as you&apos;re all very familiar with right we have kind of 2 generations of problem the first generation was how do you actually present um especially real world identity documents but anything that is in the physical world um to a website right and that really meant um up until recently and Still Remains for many sites holding a document up to a webcam I literally had to do it last night to bootstrap a new device and it&apos;s just the most infuriatingly awful experience um and um you know you scan the document you do a live check um most people have to scan it 2 or 3 times because you know you&apos;re trying to align to a webcam that is um. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="information">Tim_Cappalli:  why is my. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Keep going off. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Speaking of its weird um uh you know you keep having to align it to the to the frame and make sure the mrz is visible and all these fun things No No 1 actually really I I shouldn&apos;t say no I hope no 1 actually enjoys this experience but maybe there&apos;s someone out there um so then then came right verifiable digital credentials and and being able to present them on the web but that meant Uh custom schemes and QR codes right that&apos;s kind of been the status quo um for a number of years now um which have very poor security properties and a and a pretty bad user experience as well um so we&apos;ve made some progress on the digital format of these documents but um the presentation got slightly better but with a lot of room to improve um so custom schemes you know these are just a I assume everyone knows what they are these are a few that are out there um they&apos;re unpredictable they&apos;re not standardized um they lead to very poor experiences here&apos;s a few um this is actually even at a date I went and found this list um last July so I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more if you notice right people keep just adding to the left or the right. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Tim_Cappalli:  right to make them more specific. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Try to have a more predictable experience um but you know you&apos;re just continuing to Kick the Can um and waiting for things to break again. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: So some of the challenges with custom schemes um right that you you can invoke invoke them from an insecure context right that could be a page served over hdb um it could be an app using an insecure channel right there&apos;s there&apos;s no binding to an actual um a a secure context whether it&apos;s on the web or on the app platform you can actually fish users via app selection right so we move you know we have fishing on the web largely solve for authentication but now we have like this app fishing problem um because you know any app can can register and claim uh uh to to to be the uh request of this um if you notice in the screenshot this is just a mockup right it does use the normal Android uh disambiguation UI but I kind of added some wallets there in Photoshop so doesn&apos;t look exactly like this but it probably should look familiar you&apos;ll notice there&apos;s like no request or or identity right who who actually is making this request it&apos;s just asking me to complete an action I have no idea who actually asked for this. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: I mentioned at the beginning it&apos;s not standardized right there&apos;s no it&apos;s actually very hard to find a formal definition for custom schemes because it&apos;s just kind of something that&apos;s always existed um and you know continues to cause issues. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Know you know there&apos;s a context switch for the user right so when I tap on a link in a in a in a website or in a service you know it just kind of takes you out of out of that context right usually it takes you to the other app after you select it and there&apos;s actually no real easy way to fall back from that if there&apos;s an error both success and error right so once I pick an app on the screen go to the app like you really can&apos;t get back easily and there&apos;s not a great way to share State as well. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Uh and the last big 1 which I think should be very clear from this screen this this uh screenshot right it&apos;s a very very poor ux for credential selection right you users don&apos;t understand wallet selection right they don&apos;t even know what a wallet is write a wallet is just an app um and so asking user to make a decision based on this information is just is just you know not not realistic for most users. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Um so a lot of this work kind of took the learnings from pass keys right as we rolled out pass keys I Was A New Concept for users you know web authentic Pho have been around forever but it was really in the work context there wasn&apos;t a ton of um usage outside of the workplace um and so you know users think users don&apos;t think about their authenticators right authenticator being their security key or or bit Warden or Google password manager right they don&apos;t think about that they think about the account or the credential itself right like like a user does not necessarily know where they store each individual thing maybe they say oh I store most of my stuff in 1 passwords. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="information">Tim_Cappalli: Apple password right like you don&apos;t think that way they think about the account they&apos;re trying to access or the individual credential. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>

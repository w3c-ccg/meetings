[2024-12-17T17:25:01.649Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What does um can you can you show an example of.
[2024-12-17T17:25:16.502Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The outer list uh so or or or let's walk back actually because I want to understand whether this is list based or API based so I'm a verifier.
[2024-12-17T17:25:19.695Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Hands over a diploma to me.
[2024-12-17T17:25:38.144Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Signed by you know example.edu and I go to I go to verify I go to look up the issuer in uh a Viv uh issue of registry what what does that initial request look like.
[2024-12-17T17:25:56.081Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What is uh the verifiers request to the issuer registry look like so when I when I want to fetch that uh original list of uh known verifiers.
[2024-12-17T17:26:36.460Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Got it is there a way for the verifier to fetch the list of all of the known okay.
[2024-12-17T17:26:53.429Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay understood and then the second question is a more General 1 sort of just positioning in the ecosystem uh how would you say how would you differentiate or explain the spec um with regards to.
[2024-12-17T17:27:14.618Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The other 2 or 3 projects that are uh aiming to do uh verified issue and verify our lists such as open ID Federation and diffs um uh credential trust establishments back so where where would you position this spec uh opposite of those 2.
[2024-12-17T17:28:33.044Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q+
[2024-12-17T17:28:33.310Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Uh sorry David.
[2024-12-17T17:28:39.908Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Oh yeah David you're right.
[2024-12-17T17:28:48.412Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Oh it's on a David if you're talking.
[2024-12-17T17:28:57.359Z]	<DavidC>	looks like you cannot hear me
[2024-12-17T17:28:57.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah we we can't quite hear you.
[2024-12-17T17:29:01.985Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: It's like you're muted on the jitsi client if that's.
[2024-12-17T17:29:07.561Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Maybe I'll get to Harrison first when we come back to you David Harrison.
[2024-12-17T17:29:41.052Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yeah I my question is that different trust Frameworks have slightly different governance right so the users of this basically are relying are trusting that trust framework so I'm just I'm I I'm just curious like does this back includes like the identify identification around the trust framework like in this case if your time of Gaia X like does it have a URL to go X and then as well as how their governance work and things like that.
[2024-12-17T17:30:56.537Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Because I I see that the there are attributes around service identifiers like why don't we have include something like trust framework identifiers or things like that what what are the pros and cons of including or not including such an identifier to the trust Frameworks.
[2024-12-17T17:31:42.905Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you thanks.
[2024-12-17T17:31:45.155Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Cool thanks David.

[2024-12-17T17:32:25.089Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	we cannot hear you.  perhaps you can type in your question
[2024-12-17T17:32:30.909Z]	<DavidC>	its safari

[2024-12-17T17:32:39.943Z]	<DavidC>	It was a comment rather than a question
[2024-12-17T17:32:49.712Z]	<Transcriber>	Lucy_Yang: Yeah question to ask I think I want to go back to on the Metro's question earlier about you know open ID Federation the other the other complimentary.
[2024-12-17T17:33:08.436Z]	<DavidC>	To describe the main difference between OID Federation and ETSI
[2024-12-17T17:33:23.220Z]	<Transcriber>	Lucy_Yang: Um like approach and to have um do we have some examples we can show like how you know um the you know the training approach that can actually approach what you know but whatever is being defined like to verify and and issue our list and the your your work is David on how can we Show an example of how that could be complimentary and to you know open ID Federation or others um potentially leveraging Reggie trust I'm saying this because you know we're we're working together.
[2024-12-17T17:33:51.380Z]	<Transcriber>	Lucy_Yang: It it probably be helpful I I you know having worked on on Reit trust project for a few years I understand you know there's like richer metadata but I haven't seen I haven't seen kind of example from you know from open ID Federation I said know many you know many are considering adopting you know using open ID Federation which is you know kind of Natural Evolution from what they're using today so if there's a kind of more concrete example um that we can show be super helpful you know for me as well so that's.

[2024-12-17T17:36:43.440Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: I'm not seeing anyone on the Queue I have some more questions my questions are more about the ccg and like you know like you're 1 of a few people or groups who are doing a CCD work item that kind of in that process I don't think we as a CCU community.
[2024-12-17T17:36:53.939Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Have that process fully refined like I just wonder if you have any comments about how we as a community could help work items like yourselves you know get through the process to like.
[2024-12-17T17:37:20.626Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Um I think the criteria is uh.
[2024-12-17T17:38:01.836Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: I might be wrong at this so people can correct me but I think the criteria is you guys tell us that you think it's finished and then we put a call out to this community group and there's open for like you know comments and objections and if and if that passes then it's finished and it can be published as like a a final report with a w3c link but it's still a ccg like a community group report I think for it to get adopted in a working group that would be up to the working group that would form right and then they decide which which work items they might want to bring in to like work on more formally to get them through like a proper w3c standard.
[2024-12-17T17:38:05.536Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: So that's separate things basically.
[2024-12-17T17:38:18.639Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: To help this group could help you get to a final report right and I think that would be the first step to which ones is the final report then it can be like oh this thing's pretty you know pretty good shape working groups would start considering.
[2024-12-17T17:38:22.157Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Um you know advancing it further I suppose.
[2024-12-17T17:38:55.543Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Yes I mean I think so that's fine to me.
[2024-12-17T17:39:19.089Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Yes um so that's kind of like the the more formal process of the ccg right can help you get a report published but I was more wondering about like.
[2024-12-17T17:39:21.602Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: We as a group of people like.

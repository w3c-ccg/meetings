Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hello this is the recording works let me double 
  check.
Harrison_Tang: Restarted give me a second.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Right uh welcome welcome everyone to this week's 
  w3c cgg meeting uh today we're very excited to have Joey Steven 
  from openai and also mom is here too uh to actually uh talk about 
  need of discussion around personhood credentials a privacy 
  preserving credential to demonstrate who's real online amid 
  artificial intelligence.
Harrison_Tang: But before we start I I I know everyone is so 
  anxious uh to actually jump into that topic but before we start I 
  just want to quickly go over some administrative stuff.
Harrison_Tang: I just want to have a quick reminder around the 
  code of ethics and professional conduct just want to make sure 
  that we hold a constructive and uh.
Harrison_Tang: Conversations here at w3c ccg we have been doing 
  that for years I never heard of any like bad comments or anything 
  like that but that just continue to do that.
Harrison_Tang: A second just a quick note on the intellectual 
  property anyone can participate in these calls are also sensitive 
  contributions to any CC items must be member ccg with full IPR 
  agreement signed so if you have any questions regards to getting 
  a w3c account or the community contributor license agreement uh 
  feel free to reach out to any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang: A quick notes about this call uh these uh calls 
  are being automatically transcribed and recorded so we will 
  publish the transcription the audio and video recording in the 
  next uh 224 to 48 hours.
Harrison_Tang: We use GT chat to cue the speakers so you can type 
  in Q Plus to add yourself to the queue or cue minus to remove I 
  will be moderating the queue.
Harrison_Tang: All right just want to take a quick moment uh for 
  the introductions and reintroduction so if you're new to the 
  community or you haven't been active and want to re-engage uh 
  please feel free to just uh unmute and actually just uh introduce 
  yourself you don't have to type in Q Plus or anything.
Harrison_Tang: It's mostly familiar faces and.
Harrison_Tang: I'm not going to call on people today so let's 
  jump to the next segment uh a quick uh want to take a quick 
  moment for the announcements and reminders so are there any 
  announcements or reminders about upcoming events or anything.
Manu Sporny:

<manu_sporny> [CFRG] Call for Adoption of Blind BBS and BBS 
  Pseudonyms
Manu Sporny:  Uh yeah just uh 1 quick 1 for this week so um and 
  it's relevant to uh the topic that we're going to talk about uh 
  today uh at the internet engineering task force in the 
  cryptography uh crypto Forum research group that's the group 
  standardizes cryptography for the internet uh and the web uh 
  there's a new call for adoption that just went out I'm going to 
  put the link in the chat channel here um it is for the adoption 
  of what's called Blind BBS in BBS pseudonyms um this particular 
  technology is super important when you want a privacy preserving 
  way of asserting you know an attribute about your about yourself 
  so we we have gotten like the core BBS the base BBS stuff through 
  the.
Manu Sporny:  ITF and CFR it's got you know good like 
  cryptographic review these are optional things that you can layer 
  on top um to achieve things like um.
<greg_bernstein> Thanks Manu!
Manu Sporny:  Proof of personhood or uh proving age um uh per 
  verifier pseudonyms uh per issue or pseudonyms uh holder 
  pseudonyms uh things of that nature so um we see it as like it's 
  it's vital technology for uh the BBS work uh so how can you help 
  um send an email to the mailing list if you think that like this 
  is useful technology and by the way we totally need this 
  technology for verifiable credentials um uh if you think this is 
  useful technology please send an email to the mailing list saying 
  that you feel that the um.
Manu Sporny:  The technology is important and you support uh its 
  adoption into the group uh again as a reminder to people that are 
  not familiar with ietf um everyone is there as an individual so 
  as an individual you have a voice as an individual you can say I 
  support the adoption of this uh technology it's really important 
  that um this adoption happens because if it doesn't happen then 
  we don't have any way of doing um you know uh pseudonym uh stuff 
  in BBS which would be like really bad.
<greg_bernstein> Pseudonyms and Anonymous holder binding!
Manu Sporny:  Um okay uh that's it and and of course uh Greg is 
  here today uh Greg who's been working on this technology Gregg 
  Bernstein who's also done presentations to this group about um uh 
  pseudonyms and and BBs is here if.
Manu Sporny:  Any questions there um.
Greg Bernstein:  Thank you Harrison.
Harrison_Tang: Well thanks man thanks great.
Harrison_Tang: I think you are on the queue.
Steven_Adler_(OpenAI): Hi um man thank you for the update on that 
  do you know when when they expect to have a decision on whether 
  it will be incorporated.
Manu Sporny:  Uh usually it takes they keep it open for like 
  anywhere from a week to a month um Greg do you know how long the.
Manu Sporny:  The review period is for this particular 1.
Greg Bernstein:  Uh this isn't even a review this is just to get 
  these documents as working group documents so we can really 
  formalize work so they.
Greg Bernstein:  To get uh I would say uh.
Greg Bernstein:  A week to a month and that will probably ask the 
  work group chairs.
Greg Bernstein:  So that's kind of the time frame.
Greg Bernstein:  Bfrg is a little looser.
Greg Bernstein:  In general uh than the rest of the iatf.
Harrison_Tang: Great any other questions.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah sorry I also meant to to say that like this is 
  work that happened at uh deaf decentralized identity Foundation 
  uh which is fantastic that the that the work happened there and 
  um you know it's being promoted to ITF for for standardization uh 
  there are a number of people in you know uh this community diff 
  you know ccg w3c that that have worked worked on it so thanks a 
  ton for our friends over at deaf as well.
Harrison_Tang: Yep big thanks.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: By the way a quick announcement so uh Kimberly's 
  uh term our culture of w3c ccg will uh end this year so we'll be 
  soliciting a new uh basically nomination for a new W3 ccg culture 
  so we'll send out an email in the next few weeks in regards to 
  the process but if you have anyone that you would like to 
  recommend uh feel free to just reach out to me or will.
Harrison_Tang: And then the.
Harrison_Tang: A quick uh preview on what's coming so next week 
  we'll have the Open session for the quarter 4 2024 review and 
  also work item updates uh so I will be sending out an email to uh 
  to the different um task forces in regards to see if they have 
  any updates there's no updates uh feel free to just say hey no 
  updates so we'll quickly go through them um and then also just 
  open up the floor uh for any discussions or topics or maybe 
  suggestions on how we can further improve and grow um next week.
Harrison_Tang: After that uh we got Heather uh to actually give 
  us the update on the February identity working group.
Harrison_Tang: All right so last calls for introductions 
  announcements reminders or if you have any updates in regards to 
  work items uh feel free to just uh type in P Q Plus or just on 
  mute.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's jump to the main agenda so again 
  we're very excited to have Joey and Stephen from openai here to 
  actually talk about present and the lead a discussion around 
  person who credentials a privacy preserving credential to 
  demonstrate who's real online and if artificial intelligence so I 
  have sent out the link to their research paper uh in the email 
  agenda uh feel free to uh you know click on that if that further 
  questions but without further Ado uh sorry the floor is shorts.

Topic: <Personhood Credentials: A Privacy-Preserving Credential to Demonstrate Who's Real Online, Amid Artificial Intelligence>

Zoë_hitzig: Great thank you so much thanks for having me it's 
  great to be able to present this work to this group.
Zoë_hitzig: Um can everyone see this screen okay.
Zoë_hitzig: I'm sure there's a better way to uh.
Zoë_hitzig: Uh to it but let's just go with this for now.
Zoë_hitzig: So I'm super excited to talk to this group the idea 
  of personhood credentials I would imagine is somewhat familiar to 
  many here I think what's exciting for me about talking to all of 
  you is that we're going to bring a perspective to this question 
  about that basically suggests that digital credentials um 
  personhood credentials being 1 of them are incredibly important 
  as a solution to some of the problems that we that we can see 
  coming.
Zoë_hitzig: Um from the widespread adoption and deployment of 
  artificial intelligence in various ways so what I'll focus on 
  today is talking about you know the content of the paper and 
  giving you an overview but I really want to accelerate through to 
  the discussion to hear ideas from you all about where to go um 
  where to go with these ideas after I've convinced you that um.
Zoë_hitzig: These sorts of privacy preserving credentials are 
  really uh 1 of the most important source of solutions and 
  protections we have.
Zoë_hitzig: Some of the coming problems.
Zoë_hitzig: Um also feel free to I don't know what the group um 
  Norms are but I don't mind being interrupted if you have 
  questions as we go along and I will adjust my timing to make sure 
  that I leave at least 15 minutes for uh questions and discussions 
  at the end.
Zoë_hitzig: So for some for some background I'm currently a 
  researcher at openai and this paper is was a massive effort from 
  a wide range of people led by my colleague Stephen Adler who's 
  here on the call who you who you just heard um and as well as 
  Trey Jane who might be on the call um and a wide range of other 
  uh.
Zoë_hitzig: Other researchers and practitioners from industry 
  Academia and the Civil sector um Manu of course was a crucial uh 
  author on this paper as was Kim Duffy who I think is on the call.
Zoë_hitzig: So I'll just briefly talk as I said I want to focus 
  in this um in this call on what we see as the problem that person 
  had credentials can respond to um and these are problems that 
  we're seeing in the AI space then I'll give a an overview of our 
  approach what we sort of outlined as a as as a A system that 
  solves the problem we've identified.
Zoë_hitzig: I will say upfront that this is not a particularly.
Zoë_hitzig: Solution we don't offer a very specific concrete 
  implementation that's not kind of the point of the paper the 
  point of the paper was to.
Zoë_hitzig: Argue for the importance of this idea and to get 
  people talking about it in a serious way and then as I said we'll 
  focus on next steps.
Zoë_hitzig: So this paper starts from a kind of basic observation 
  but 1 that is increasingly alarming and AI policy circles which 
  is that it's getting harder to tell if there's a person behind 
  various kinds of activity on the internet um and this is because 
  this is kind of for 2 reasons or 2 Trends in AI that are pushing 
  in this direction the first is 1 that we roughly talk about as in 
  indistinguishability it's becoming much easier for um to create 
  content that is indistinguishable from Human content um and this 
  is not just like.
Zoë_hitzig: You know highly uh highly persuasive text that sounds 
  like it was written thoughtfully by some person and um but also 
  avatars increasingly deep fakes and so forth and increasingly um 
  actions can be taken around the Internet by AI agents in a way 
  that makes them even their actions and distinguishable from the 
  sorts of actions that um a human would take and by the and to 
  think about this um.
Zoë_hitzig:  you know think.
Zoë_hitzig: About some of the tools that have come out recently 
  like in the last month anthropic released a computer using agent 
  for example which clicks around the web um much like a human 
  does.
Zoë_hitzig: And at the same time as many people know.
Zoë_hitzig: The uh these AI tools are increasingly widely 
  available their costs are decreasing and there's ton there are 
  tons of accessible models um especially open weights models um 
  are easily accessible to.
Zoë_hitzig: Anyone with uh an ability to access the internet and 
  figure out how to run them.
Zoë_hitzig: 1 of the observations that we really.
Zoë_hitzig: Try to try to begin with is the person in 
  credentials.
Zoë_hitzig: End up are end up looking like a solution that are 
  that is highly that is robust to highly capable AI as in it 
  provides a way of identifying.
Zoë_hitzig: When some activity is coming from from a person in a 
  way that's robust to C highly capable Ai and also in a way that 
  is privacy preserving and inclusive so those are kind of like the 
  3 der that we think about in this paper that we want a solution 
  that allows us to sort of authenticate like anonymously activity 
  on the internet but in a way that is privacy preserving and also 
  inclusive so some of the other strategies that you might think 
  about if you're trying to think about how to counter AI powered 
  deception is you know you might think first of captures and 
  browser challenges of various kinds or an anomaly detection 
  systems.
Zoë_hitzig: What we want to argue here is.
Zoë_hitzig: Those uh the existing approaches are not going to be 
  robust to the kinds of tools that are coming out these days um 
  other strategies that you might consider could be economic 
  barriers for example.
Zoë_hitzig: Um you know this is what for example Twitter does 
  right now.
Zoë_hitzig: In order to get an authentication a blue check mark 
  you simply have to pay in some way um those approaches may work 
  but they're not particularly inclusive.
Zoë_hitzig: Um in AI policy circles people talk a lot about 
  synthetic content.
Zoë_hitzig: Tools like watermarking and content provenance.
Zoë_hitzig: Our argument is going to be the personhood 
  credentials can really complement these sorts of approaches.
Zoë_hitzig: And then you know another another possibility is 
  that.
Zoë_hitzig: 1 way of telling who's a person online is to require 
  a.
Zoë_hitzig: Of verification through appearance-based and 
  documents based.
Zoë_hitzig: Verification processes like asking for a picture of a 
  driver's license or you know now sometimes if you're doing some 
  remote uh remote.
Zoë_hitzig: For example if you're starting a job and you have to 
  do it remotely you'll do some kind of uh live video call to check 
  that you are the person you say you are.
Zoë_hitzig: Our argument is going to be that not only are these 
  not particularly privacy preserving like there might be some 
  solutions where it's way overboard to ask people to provide their 
  identification or hop on a video call and say show exactly who 
  they are.
Zoë_hitzig: But also these these Solutions are also not robust to 
  highly capable AI it's getting increasingly easy to spoof a 
  driver's license in a really convincing way um it's getting 
  increasingly easy to use a video deep fake Avatar of some kind 
  and get on a zoom call um using a likeness that is not your own.
Zoë_hitzig: What we're going to what we argue in the paper is 
  that we need some kind of new Solutions and.
Zoë_hitzig: Been so far slightly vague about what exactly we're 
  trying to what kinds of AI powered deception we're really trying 
  to prevent and to sort of fix ideas for all of you.
Zoë_hitzig: I'll talk about just 3 kind of broad areas.
Zoë_hitzig: 1 area you can think of as like reducing the impact 
  of sock puppeting so people pretending to be someone they're not 
  online and often malicious actors whether they're trying to do 
  fraud or some kind of political manipulation will make many many 
  profiles um that are supposedly representing a particular you 
  know particular.
Zoë_hitzig: Real people but in fact these are sock puppets um we 
  also think about mitigating various kinds of Bot attacks so.
Zoë_hitzig: In a world where it's very cheap to send agents out 
  in AI agents out into the web and make tons of accounts um we 
  worry a lot about the various kinds of attacks that this could 
  enable on um important Digital Services.
Zoë_hitzig: Um there's also a kind of more more futuristic though 
  not that futuristic use case that we start thinking about in the 
  paper and that is part of a broader open wide open question um 
  about how these agents are going how these AI agents are going to 
  work across the web and and how we're going to make sure that 
  they are uh acting on behalf of real people.
Zoë_hitzig: And that is um we think the personhood credentials 
  could be a a really valuable way of maintaining you know the 
  anonymity of the internet that we hold dear in this world where 
  AI agents are running around and doing things on people on humans 
  behalf if there were no way of authenticating AI agents at all 
  then we imagine we would see lots of scaled deception um and you 
  know to a degree that could really overwhelm the internet um.
Zoë_hitzig: But with personhood credentials there could be a some 
  really simple ways to at least verify that 1 an agent.
Zoë_hitzig: Is acting they're acting on behalf of some person and 
  you don't have to know which but some person.
Zoë_hitzig: Um so this uh new paradigm of agentic AI is really 
  motivating um for a lot of the paper and happy to.
Zoë_hitzig:  go into.
Zoë_hitzig: More on that when we get into the discussion later 
  on.
Zoë_hitzig: Um as I said 1 of the big worries and again 1 of the 
  things motivating a lot of us who worked on this paper is that we 
  worry about a future where.
Zoë_hitzig: AI the the widespread use of AI makes.
Zoë_hitzig: Digital Services so hard to use um they become so 
  overwhelmed that people that service providers end up resorting 
  to highly non-private methods of authentication um and you know 
  some groups around the world are already trying to tie internet 
  usage to personal.
Zoë_hitzig: Identity in various ways and that's kind of like the 
  the a a motivating.
Zoë_hitzig: Um a motivating bad case I'll say that.
Zoë_hitzig: That that partially we think person had credentials 
  can help us to avoid.
Zoë_hitzig: Um and as I said I'm not sure how many of you have 
  been paying close attention in the AI policy space but 1 of the 
  major policy tools in in discussion right now are various kinds 
  of content provenance um and maybe you guys are familiar with the 
  content uh the ctpa group who are trying to come up with 
  standards for making sure that there's a kind of standard way of.
Zoë_hitzig: Providing a manifest you know a metadata manifests 
  that says where various kinds of media came from.
Zoë_hitzig: And what we want to suggest in this paper is that 
  personhood credentials kind of are like very complimentary they 
  take a different approach rather than trying to figure out 
  whether some piece of AI media was produced or whether some piece 
  of media was produced by an AI or a person we say well forget 
  about the media itself let's think about the account or let's 
  think about you know the user is that user a real person.
Zoë_hitzig: So I'll go.
Zoë_hitzig: Now through our approach to the problem which as I 
  said at the beginning is kind of like a big picture um outline of 
  the types of of the properties that we think a person had 
  credential system should have.
Zoë_hitzig: We landed on 2 fundamental requirements of personhood 
  credential systems.
Zoë_hitzig: Um I should also note that many of you may be 
  familiar with the term proof of personhood which is in many ways 
  essentially what we're describing we chose to use a different um 
  a different term in this paper because proof of personhood.
Zoë_hitzig: Varied and have taken on many different meanings in 
  blockchain communities and so we wanted to be able to sort of 
  create our own definition of like exactly what we mean when we 
  talk about a personhood credential and so you know this does this 
  does describe some existing systems.
Zoë_hitzig: Systems that describe themselves as proof of 
  personhood.
Harrison_Tang: Joy sorry to interject do you mind uh clarifying 
  what's the difference between uh person who credential proof of 
  personhood and proof of humanity know.
Zoë_hitzig: Um basically there's.
Zoë_hitzig: In this paper we wanted to outline a very specific 
  set of requirements and definitions.
Zoë_hitzig: A personhood and proof of humanity don't actually 
  have particularly specific definitions they tend to refer to a 
  wide variety of protocols in you know vaguely associated with the 
  blockchain space and so to distinguish ourselves from.
Zoë_hitzig: Them or just kind of make something a bit more 
  specific we use this term personhood credentials so it's really 
  just that we wanted to be able to uh make a concrete definition.
Zoë_hitzig: Regardless of what is already out there.
Zoë_hitzig: So the the core idea here is that.
Zoë_hitzig:  the first.
<nicky_hickman> There are also 'proof of liveliness' checks in 
  identity proofing processes that rely on pictures or videors
Zoë_hitzig: First foundational requirement of a of a person to 
  credential system is that there has to be some method of limiting 
  the number of credentials per user.
Zoë_hitzig: Um and specifically we say that there needs to be 1 
  credenza.
Zoë_hitzig: The second foundational requirement is on linkable 
  pseudonymity.
Zoë_hitzig: This is our this is the kind of privacy that we think 
  this this sort of system should aim for um this is 1 in which the 
  user interacts with Services through some kind of service 
  specific pseudonym and all of their activity is both untraceable 
  by the issuer and also unlink across service providers even when 
  the service providers collude with each other and with the 
  issuer.
Zoë_hitzig: So these are these are the uh the requirements that 
  we think are most important for a personhood credential system 
  obviously they're still vague and need to be filled in with more 
  specificity um but there are protocols that satisfy these 
  requirements in some way um obviously you know what it how well 
  do they mitigate theft or transfer is always going to be a 
  question um you're not going to be able to perfectly uh.
Zoë_hitzig: All of these things.
Zoë_hitzig: And that's another another reason why we wanted to 
  sort of distinguish ourselves a little bit from.
Zoë_hitzig:  proof of.
Zoë_hitzig: Personhood work is that often they have their own 
  ideas about.
Zoë_hitzig: Exactly uh you know what exactly the foundational 
  requirements are and often.
Zoë_hitzig: They're aiming for a kind of extreme uniqueness.
Zoë_hitzig: Um where you know the the place in the trade-off that 
  where they really put their weight is making sure that no person 
  has has 2 um and they also sort of.
Zoë_hitzig: Often have kind of global Ambitions and and want to.
Zoë_hitzig: And often sort of operate under the assumption that 
  there would be only 1 issuer of of personhood credentials.
Zoë_hitzig: But we can talk more about all of that in the 
  discussion.
Zoë_hitzig: For now what I'll highlight is the personhood 
  credentials need to lean into what AI cannot and will not soon be 
  able to do.
Zoë_hitzig: I'm saying that they definitely can't.
Zoë_hitzig: Right now and probably not for a while as they can't 
  pass as a person in the real world.
Zoë_hitzig: We like to think about the.
Zoë_hitzig:  person who.
Zoë_hitzig: Credential is requiring some kind of offline 
  component now that doesn't necessarily mean that a person has to 
  show up.
Zoë_hitzig:  you know.
Zoë_hitzig: Live like as if they're showing up to the DMV to do 
  some kind of in-person check it could be that they have some 
  physical document like that's offline they have some physical 
  document that you know itself required you know something like 
  being born for example if if it's a birth certificate um.
Zoë_hitzig: Or perhaps it's a driver's license which required at 
  some point um taking a driver a driving test.
Zoë_hitzig: So I guess what I'm saying here is.
Zoë_hitzig: There needs to be some kind of offline component in 
  the phc issuance process but it doesn't have to necessarily be 
  that the issuer is going to uh confront the the user in person 
  themselves.
Zoë_hitzig: I'll describe now the sort of enrollment and usage 
  process that we have in mind here.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> One PHC 
  issuer to rule them all... seems like the UN might be the most 
  likely (and that's not very) candidate.
Zoë_hitzig: And again this is something that we can talk about 
  more in the discussion to talk through specific ways that this 
  could uh be implemented but the basic idea here is that the user 
  there we like to imagine a world with many possible or multiple 
  possible issuers not too many but a few um.
Zoë_hitzig: Where the user is going to request their credential 
  and provide a particular kind of evidence that the issuer asks 
  for.
Zoë_hitzig: Issuer is going to do some kind of validity check.
Zoë_hitzig:  where they're.
<harrison_tang> I don't believe in one credential to rule them 
  all :)
Zoë_hitzig: A is this are is the person in question actually a 
  person and they're also doing some uniqueness check because 
  remember there's this requirement of a credential limit 1 1.
<dmitri_zagidulin> what I'm not seeing on this diagram is any 
  sort of revocation / conflict resolution mechanisms
Zoë_hitzig: And then if both of those checks pass they hand over 
  this personhood credential to the user.
Zoë_hitzig: We think of the user kind of holding their personhood 
  credential in a digital wallet.
Zoë_hitzig: And then they can use their their personhood 
  credential around the web with various different applications um 
  various different service providers and all the while it's very 
  important they're not going to be revealing any details about 
  their credentials so service providers will always be using.
Zoë_hitzig: Kind of zero knowledge proof um possibly with a 
  nullifier if it's important for the service provider to not allow 
  duplicate accounts.
Zoë_hitzig:  so you.
<manu_sporny> Yes, this is one of the toughest parts of the 
  problem... how many issuers, and should they (or should they not) 
  collude to ensure 1 PHC per person. Or, how many sybils are 
  acceptable in the system.
Zoë_hitzig: It might be that if we're thinking about the service 
  provider as some social media platform like Twitter it might be 
  the case that they want to try to enforce.
Zoë_hitzig: Rule where each person has only 1 account.
Zoë_hitzig: So in that case they could make some application 
  specific pseudonym to ensure that they're not giving 1 user more 
  than 1 account.
Zoë_hitzig: Keep in mind there are multiple issuers so if we 
  think through this you know let's imagine there are 2 different 
  issuers 1 might be you know.
Zoë_hitzig: Scanning some part of your body like a palm or an 
  iris and issuing uh a personhood credential on the basis of of 
  some kind of biometric scan.
<harrison_tang> How can we ensure 1 PHC per person?  For example, 
  1 person can have multiple devices, so does this mean that only 1 
  device could hold that PHC?
Zoë_hitzig: Might also go to an issuer that's perhaps a 
  government issue or who you know scans a driver's license and and 
  without storing any details um or tying any details about my 
  identity to my credential hands me a credential on the basis of 
  this.
Zoë_hitzig: So then I could be in a position where I have 2 
  credentials 1 1 that comes from um the biometric issuer and 1 
  that comes from some kind of government issuer and so clearly the 
  in the system I would be able to get to social media accounts 
  even um.
Zoë_hitzig: 2 authenticated social media accounts because I have 
  2 different credentials and basically what we're going to the 
  position that we take in the paper and you know hap very happy to 
  discuss this because I think we all had really valuable 
  discussions about this in the course of writing the paper um.
Zoë_hitzig:  to us.
Zoë_hitzig: That seems fine um it it seems like the the most 
  important thing is being able to in some way limit activity 
  rather than to enforce um a strong notion of uniqueness.
<nivas_s> I have a question - how does the service provider trust 
  the issuer is the right one and not a fake one? (Please bear with 
  me if a silly question as I am a newbie in the domain)
Zoë_hitzig: Um so as I said 1 1 possible way of like achieving 
  this offline component is to have to use some kind of zero 
  knowledge proof of just holding a government ID without.
Zoë_hitzig: Revealing which ID so the issuer could um and there 
  are there are some early protocols like um.
Zoë_hitzig: Um Annan Adar for example that are.
Zoë_hitzig: Regarding to do this on the base of basis of national 
  uh.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Nivas - not a silly question at all. it's the 
  central and crucial question for anything to do with Verifiable 
  Credentials.
Zoë_hitzig: So as I said you know when I was highlighting the 
  social media example.
<dmitri_zagidulin> and the answer is - we'll need Issuer 
  registries. (and registries of registries)
<harrison_tang> @Nivas You need a trust framework
Zoë_hitzig: Um we favor we in the paper we sort of identified 
  this kind of fundamental trade-off.
Zoë_hitzig: Sorry something happened to my student we identify 
  these sorts of fundamental trade-offs between systems that have 1 
  creds systems that have unlimited credentials and systems that 
  have bounded credentials so as I said we favor this approach 
  where there are multiple issuers so it is possible you know 
  you're not going to fully prevent a kind of civil attack but you 
  will really limit the scope of those attacks because there will 
  be a small finite number of potential trusted issuers.
<nivas_s> @Dmitri and @Harrison - Is this what the GAN (Global 
  acceptance network) is all about?
Zoë_hitzig: And so this trade-off that we described here is that 
  you know of course if you can the the very best way to counter 
  scalable AI based deception would be to do something like you 
  know.
Zoë_hitzig: Where where there's some like.
Zoë_hitzig: Database that has everyone's Anonymous um Anonymous a 
  person had credentials in it.
Zoë_hitzig: Think that this is.
Zoë_hitzig: Bad type of solution from the perspective of privacy 
  and civil liberties I mean I definitely don't have to say that 
  you know I don't probably don't have to convince this group that 
  that's um for many reasons a A system that would.
<harrison_tang> @Nivas Yes.  And we will have Drummond to present 
  and talk about GAN next year.
Zoë_hitzig: To uh potentially very bad outcomes.
Zoë_hitzig: But at the same time what we're suggesting here is 
  that if you have no method of limiting the activity online then 
  you really lose out on your ability to counter scalable deception 
  to the degree which you may actually so we may actually see so 
  much overwhelming activity on the internet that people resort to 
  to certain kinds of um aggressive privacy invasive approaches so 
  that's why we we see a bounded credential ecosystem as 1 that.
Zoë_hitzig: Uh balances this trade-off between protecting privacy 
  and civil liberties while also countering scalable deception.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> oh, I think 
  I see... I missed the part where "per issuer" means multiple 
  *PHC* issuers can be in play. Perhaps one from regional govt, 
  another from employer, another from NGO membership 
  organization...
Zoë_hitzig: Um and on that note as I'm talking about these 
  trade-offs of course any phc system is going to be a 
  sociotechnical system that has to be carefully uh designed and 
  care and many implementation challenges have to be considered 
  such as.
<nivas_s> @Harrison Thank you for the answers and clarification
Zoë_hitzig: All these uh how these credentials might end up 
  impacting access to Digital Services how they impact people's 
  feelings of of safety and and confidence and free expression um 
  of course there's a there are questions about the power dynamics 
  of Digital Services and the degree to which different phc systems 
  are vulnerable to mistakes and intentional subversion by 
  different actors.
Zoë_hitzig: And you know these are all the big questions we 
  believe that there are.
Zoë_hitzig:  you know.
<drummond_reed_(ipad)> GAN is super interested in PHCs. We have 
  several of us attending this call. Really love this paper.
<manu_sporny> Yep, Ted, that's one of the open questions -- how 
  many issuers are enough? (in all the senses of "enough")
Zoë_hitzig: If we if we all start if we all put our heads 
  together and start thinking about this really really carefully 
  and thoughtfully we believe that.
Zoë_hitzig: Ways to implement phc systems that would um.
Zoë_hitzig: Maintain Equitable access and free expression and 
  checks on Power and be robust to to attack an error.
Zoë_hitzig: So with that um in the paper we outline a wide range 
  of next steps in um for governments and technologists and 
  standards bodies and you know public consultation will be a very 
  important part of socializing this idea uh you can't be a it 
  can't be a solution that comes from the top down people need to 
  understand the cryptography they need to understand why it's 
  valuable um.
Zoë_hitzig: And so we talked about ways in which we can adapt 
  existing digital systems and also prioritize person and 
  credentials through policy and um technology.
Zoë_hitzig:  in particular.
<darius_kazemi_(harvard_asml)> also how does one become an 
  issuer, how hard is it, how much money and time does it cost, 
  etc. looking at SSL issuers might be instructive re: where this 
  fails/succeeds
Zoë_hitzig:  this is where.
Zoë_hitzig: I'll stop so that we have plenty of time for 
  discussion but I know that this group has particular um skills 
  and perspectives to offer and we'd be super excited to hear.
Zoë_hitzig:  what your.
Zoë_hitzig: Reactions are I mean I think 1 1 very clear next step 
  is to move towards some more Concrete technical.
Zoë_hitzig: Ations um and you know potentially the this group 
  might be interested in spinning off another kind of working group 
  on personhood credentials in particular or maybe it fits into an 
  existing initiative to um try to make these ideas more concrete 
  and to bring them to a wider audience.
Zoë_hitzig: So I'll stop there and yeah let's let's do discussion 
  I mean we can format it as Q&A my um my co-author Stevens here 
  too and Kim and Manu I want all of us to you know be part of the 
  discussion.
<olvis_e._gil_ríos> Hello! My name is Olvis E. Gil Ríos, founder 
  of OG Technologies EU, I am currently working on blockchain 
  standards for cross-border payments using DIDs/VCs.  Very 
  interesting presentation! My question is: How can developers 
  interested in building on PHC learn more?
<kim_duffy> +1,
Manu Sporny:  Yeah um thank you Zoe that was like uh that was 
  awesome um uh thank you for you know uh taking the time and 
  presenting it to the group and I know as you said this group is 
  like super interested in the work in really wants to see it um uh 
  uh be realized right so um I guess the you know the the question 
  is like you know where do we go from here and what do we do um I 
  also before going to that though I also want to kind of point out 
  to the rest of the group that um uh uh Stephen and Zoe in shrey 
  have been like absolutely amazing and awesome through this entire 
  like exercise like this has been going on for you know uh uh 2 
  plus years a year plus in there are some of the best Bridge 
  builders that I've seen operate across like all these different 
  groups being people together to kind of work on this problem um 
  so you know if you're interested in working on this stuff I 
  can't.
Manu Sporny:   More highly recommend.
Manu Sporny:  And you know working.
Manu Sporny:  With uh Stephen and Zoe um you know on this stuff 
  um that said there you know we have seen signals this is mostly 
  for like you know uh so in Stephen we've seen signals where like 
  people are already starting to work on this stuff like they read 
  the paper and they're kind of like uh charging for it so like 
  just last week I think uh Kim you you have more details on this 
  but like there are a number of people at D that have gotten 
  together uh to create a vocabulary where meaning like a way of 
  digitally expressing this credential where a subset of it is 
  around a personhood credential in last week we talked about like 
  hey we need to get this thing you know in front of uh you know uh 
  Stephen Zoe get their thoughts on it and then try to put like an 
  actual like actually issue 1 of these credentials in like a um in 
  like a a playground setting and and just get the technology kind 
  of sorted out um I'm interested in.
Manu Sporny:   Hearing from.
Manu Sporny:  In the community.
Manu Sporny:  Where else you know work is happening I know 
  Drummond said that there's some stuff that's going on uh in gain 
  uh as well so so yeah really interested in hearing about like 
  other places people have seen personhood credentials.
Manu Sporny:  Pop up as like.
Manu Sporny:  You know forming real real things uh that's.
Harrison_Tang: On your next in the queue.
https://github.com/andorsk/awesome-proof-of-personhood
Andor: Yeah I think I think first of all fantastic presentation 
  thank you so much um actually Manu your your points really well 
  noted right here I'm going to point in a link I started after 
  this paper indexing personage credentials and or uh just person 
  who uh sort of methodologies and types and just uh we need to 
  remove it in depth.
Andor: So if anybody would like to contribute or help adding to 
  the index I think that'd be really appreciated um so uh feel free 
  to I just sent the link on the uh chats and uh would appreciate 
  um people pushing in their their projects so thank you.
Harrison_Tang: And also there's a a question in the chat how can 
  developers interested in building on PHT learn more.
Harrison_Tang: So I I I think some of you guys already kind of 
  talked about the anything else that.
Zoë_hitzig: This page from indoors seems like a great place to 
  start.
Harrison_Tang: That was that was what I was gonna say so.
<olvis_e._gil_ríos> Thank you!
Harrison_Tang: Great cool uh dimitry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah I wanted to ask if the if openai or the 
  paper authors uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Have thought about a uh revocation and 
  conflict resolution architecture.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh because as we all know verifiable 
  credentials are great against being forged or stolen but offer no 
  protection against being voluntarily shared or you know uh shared 
  for for money Etc and so I'm curious uh uh if any thought went 
  into the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh reporting moderation and conflict 
  resolution side of the credentials.
Zoë_hitzig: Yeah I I 1 Thing also and others can feel free to 
  jump in as the 1 perspective that we came to and writing this 
  paper was that in some ways of course theft and or sharing a 
  credentials selling a credential is a huge issue and especially 
  in a world with multiple issuers you know people might have more 
  incentives to.
Zoë_hitzig: S or to um.
Zoë_hitzig: Or to uh uh sell them in some way.
Zoë_hitzig: These sort of came to the came to the view in this 
  paper and and others can can correct me if this is not a 
  representation of your view but I I came to the view that to some 
  degree it's.
Zoë_hitzig: Okay cost to not have um you know to have these 
  systems be occasionally sold or stolen or or shared and part of 
  that is that 1 of the big as I focused on in in the in in the 
  problem statement.
Zoë_hitzig: We're really talking about scalable AI deception and 
  to some degree just being able to put a limit on things is 
  incredibly valuable so even if it's not really that you know this 
  person had credentials like exactly given to who it uh you know 
  is that is exactly being used by the person who it was issued to 
  there's still this sense in which the overall activity.
<greg_bernstein> Pseudonyms can help put a limit on things.
Zoë_hitzig: And overall like fraudulent activity in the system is 
  largely reduced um and that said we also um in terms of the 
  actual thinking in the paper so so that's 1 part of my answer is 
  like just some degree you know.
Zoë_hitzig: You're right and we kind of take the view that it's 
  okay to some degree because there's still this overall limit.
Zoë_hitzig: Um in the paper we also talked a bit about um 
  revocation and recovery and reau reauthentication kind of taking 
  the view that you know of course it's inconvenient to have to 
  reauthenticate frequently but we would tend to favor tighter 
  expiration limits generally for this reason exactly um.
Zoë_hitzig: While it's not like perfect and we can't transfer 
  like we can't prevent people from transferring our our selling 
  you know tight expiration limits would go a large.
Zoë_hitzig:  a large.
Zoë_hitzig: Part of the way.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I uh if I if I could clarify specifically 
  meant uh sharing with AI is not with people uh does that does 
  your answer still apply to that.
Zoë_hitzig: Yeah and um the answer still applies and I think that 
  you know again.
Zoë_hitzig: 1 of the 1 of the sort of positive use cases that we 
  talked about in the paper is this idea of verified delegation so 
  yeah sure you know give your credential to an AI agent but you 
  know again you'll only really be able to.
Zoë_hitzig: Will still be.
Zoë_hitzig: Pretty Limited in you know the number of AI agents 
  that you could give your credential to.
Pat Adler:  Make mad on.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I'm not sure I see the part that would limit 
  how many malicious AI agents I could share my PHC with
Pat Adler:  Yeah um yeah I I think what's always said is totally 
  correct like I we we did not go so far as to lay out uh an 
  architecture I would say for Recovery or revocation those 
  certainly we recognize that they are like important and useful um 
  but also maybe less critical than sometimes understood and so in 
  the case of AI like Zoe Zoe is alluding to you know if a dating 
  app has a rule that you may not delegate your account to an AI 
  system uh and you decide to do it anyway right you do it 
  illicitly.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Steven - I see, so you're envisioning 
  per-application revocation mechanisms, rather than part of the 
  infrastructure
Pat Adler:  You know you're violating the terms of service it's 
  not great uh if the site determines that you've done it they can 
  actually now just you they can suspend your account and you can't 
  create another 1 and so there is a pretty natural bound on what 
  you can do um and likewise you wouldn't be able to use your 
  credential to power 20 accounts on the platform or do fishing at 
  scale or things um to to the extent that uh the platform decides 
  that they want to limit to a certain number of accounts per 
  credential so hopefully that illustrates how you you can still do 
  elicit sharing in various ways but at significantly lower impact 
  than maybe in other systems.
Zoë_hitzig: Yeah and I just tagged yeah thank you Stephen that's 
  really helpful clarification and I I would just tack on that this 
  is another kind of it may be subtle but it is another sort of 
  difference from what we typically think of as like proof of 
  personhood protocols which really do care a lot about the uh 
  credential only being used by the person it was issued to like 
  we're a little.
Zoë_hitzig: Uh our view is a little looser than that.
Harrison_Tang: Money do you want to add to that.
Manu Sporny:  Um sure yeah uh.
Manu Sporny:   I I think.
Manu Sporny:  Yes so plus 1 to what you know um uh Zoe and 
  Stephen have already said um I I'm pointing out something that 
  Gregg Bernstein who's been working on the BBS pseudonym stuff uh 
  pointed out in the chat Channel um so you know this community 
  knows that there's no such thing as a perfect security system 
  there will always be uh security failures in any any system that 
  you that you build right so um we are expecting a certain amount 
  of cables in the system it's just a natural consequence of uh the 
  balance that we're trying to uh strike uh I think Demetri your 
  point is like how do you make it so the syllables don't make it 
  so that the system itself falls apart like there's a certain 
  level of fraud in a system that leads to system failure and we 
  don't want to go past that line so um uh so there are a number of 
  variables here right um we don't want 1 Uber issuer that there's 
  only 1 you know you the United Nations of personhood credentials 
  and there's only.
Manu Sporny:   1 Of those in the world.
<steven_adler> @Dmitri you asked if revocation happens at a 
  service-provider level rather than the infra overall - it could 
  happen at both, but that's a helpful way of describing it. Moreso 
  than revocation though, a service-provider can just 'burn' a 
  credential for their service once it's used, independent of 
  revoking
<olvis_e._gil_ríos> Thank you so much!

[2024-11-12T17:04:18.350Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: But before we start I I I know everyone is so anxious uh to actually jump into that topic but before we start I just want to quickly go over some administrative stuff.

[2024-11-12T17:06:59.156Z]	<Matthieu_C.>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:07:10.232Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh yeah just uh 1 quick 1 for this week so um and it's relevant to uh the topic that we're going to talk about uh today uh at the internet engineering task force in the cryptography uh crypto Forum research group that's the group standardizes cryptography for the internet uh and the web uh there's a new call for adoption that just went out I'm going to put the link in the chat channel here um it is for the adoption of what's called Blind BBS in BBS pseudonyms um this particular technology is super important when you want a privacy preserving way of asserting you know an attribute about your about yourself so we we have gotten like the core BBS the base BBS stuff through the.
[2024-11-12T17:07:20.561Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: ITF and CFR it's got you know good like cryptographic review these are optional things that you can layer on top um to achieve things like um.
[2024-11-12T17:07:42.597Z]	<Greg_Bernstein>	Thanks Manu!
[2024-11-12T17:07:49.666Z]	<Greg_Natran>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:07:57.631Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Proof of personhood or uh proving age um uh per verifier pseudonyms uh per issue or pseudonyms uh holder pseudonyms uh things of that nature so um we see it as like it's it's vital technology for uh the BBS work uh so how can you help um send an email to the mailing list if you think that like this is useful technology and by the way we totally need this technology for verifiable credentials um uh if you think this is useful technology please send an email to the mailing list saying that you feel that the um.
[2024-11-12T17:08:12.553Z]	<David_Waite>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:08:30.698Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The technology is important and you support uh its adoption into the group uh again as a reminder to people that are not familiar with ietf um everyone is there as an individual so as an individual you have a voice as an individual you can say I support the adoption of this uh technology it's really important that um this adoption happens because if it doesn't happen then we don't have any way of doing um you know uh pseudonym uh stuff in BBS which would be like really bad.
[2024-11-12T17:08:40.852Z]	<Greg_Bernstein>	Pseudonyms and Anonymous holder binding!
[2024-11-12T17:08:44.287Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Um okay uh that's it and and of course uh Greg is here today uh Greg who's been working on this technology Gregg Bernstein who's also done presentations to this group about um uh pseudonyms and and BBs is here if.
[2024-11-12T17:08:46.726Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Any questions there um.
[2024-11-12T17:08:49.779Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: Thank you Harrison.

[2024-11-12T17:09:10.396Z]	<Transcriber>	Steven_Adler_(OpenAI): Hi um man thank you for the update on that do you know when when they expect to have a decision on whether it will be incorporated.
[2024-11-12T17:09:20.846Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh usually it takes they keep it open for like anywhere from a week to a month um Greg do you know how long the.
[2024-11-12T17:09:24.924Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The review period is for this particular 1.

[2024-11-12T17:09:35.022Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: Uh this isn't even a review this is just to get these documents as working group documents so we can really formalize work so they.
[2024-11-12T17:09:39.574Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: To get uh I would say uh.
[2024-11-12T17:09:45.271Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: A week to a month and that will probably ask the work group chairs.
[2024-11-12T17:09:51.533Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: So that's kind of the time frame.
[2024-11-12T17:09:54.469Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: Bfrg is a little looser.
[2024-11-12T17:09:58.520Z]	<Transcriber>	Greg_Bernstein: In general uh than the rest of the iatf.

[2024-11-12T17:10:35.224Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah sorry I also meant to to say that like this is work that happened at uh deaf decentralized identity Foundation uh which is fantastic that the that the work happened there and um you know it's being promoted to ITF for for standardization uh there are a number of people in you know uh this community diff you know ccg w3c that that have worked worked on it so thanks a ton for our friends over at deaf as well.
[2024-11-12T17:10:36.977Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yep big thanks.
[2024-11-12T17:10:40.760Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
[2024-11-12T17:11:13.272Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: By the way a quick announcement so uh Kimberly's uh term our culture of w3c ccg will uh end this year so we'll be soliciting a new uh basically nomination for a new W3 ccg culture so we'll send out an email in the next few weeks in regards to the process but if you have anyone that you would like to recommend uh feel free to just reach out to me or will.
[2024-11-12T17:11:17.655Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And then the.
[2024-11-12T17:11:53.055Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: A quick uh preview on what's coming so next week we'll have the Open session for the quarter 4 2024 review and also work item updates uh so I will be sending out an email to uh to the different um task forces in regards to see if they have any updates there's no updates uh feel free to just say hey no updates so we'll quickly go through them um and then also just open up the floor uh for any discussions or topics or maybe suggestions on how we can further improve and grow um next week.

[2024-11-12T17:11:59.465Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: After that uh we got Heather uh to actually give us the update on the February identity working group.

[2024-11-12T17:12:55.063Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right let's jump to the main agenda so again we're very excited to have Joey and Stephen from openai here to actually talk about present and the lead a discussion around person who credentials a privacy preserving credential to demonstrate who's real online and if artificial intelligence so I have sent out the link to their research paper uh in the email agenda uh feel free to uh you know click on that if that further questions but without further Ado uh sorry the floor is shorts.
[2024-11-12T17:13:03.232Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	Topic: <Personhood Credentials: A Privacy-Preserving Credential to Demonstrate Who's Real Online, Amid Artificial Intelligence>
[2024-11-12T17:13:04.378Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Great thank you so much thanks for having me it's great to be able to present this work to this group.
[2024-11-12T17:13:07.859Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um can everyone see this screen okay.
[2024-11-12T17:13:11.791Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I'm sure there's a better way to uh.
[2024-11-12T17:13:16.295Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Uh to it but let's just go with this for now.
[2024-11-12T17:13:33.421Z]	<Stephan_Baur>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:13:51.986Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So I'm super excited to talk to this group the idea of personhood credentials I would imagine is somewhat familiar to many here I think what's exciting for me about talking to all of you is that we're going to bring a perspective to this question about that basically suggests that digital credentials um personhood credentials being 1 of them are incredibly important as a solution to some of the problems that we that we can see coming.
[2024-11-12T17:14:17.465Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um from the widespread adoption and deployment of artificial intelligence in various ways so what I'll focus on today is talking about you know the content of the paper and giving you an overview but I really want to accelerate through to the discussion to hear ideas from you all about where to go um where to go with these ideas after I've convinced you that um.
[2024-11-12T17:14:23.693Z]	<Darius_Kazemi_(Applied_Social_Media_Lab,_Harvard)>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:14:27.356Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: These sorts of privacy preserving credentials are really uh 1 of the most important source of solutions and protections we have.
[2024-11-12T17:14:29.350Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Some of the coming problems.
[2024-11-12T17:14:47.381Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um also feel free to I don't know what the group um Norms are but I don't mind being interrupted if you have questions as we go along and I will adjust my timing to make sure that I leave at least 15 minutes for uh questions and discussions at the end.
[2024-11-12T17:15:06.650Z]	<Darius_Kazemi_(Applied_Social_Media_Lab,_Harvard)>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:15:12.010Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So for some for some background I'm currently a researcher at openai and this paper is was a massive effort from a wide range of people led by my colleague Stephen Adler who's here on the call who you who you just heard um and as well as Trey Jane who might be on the call um and a wide range of other uh.
[2024-11-12T17:15:28.043Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Other researchers and practitioners from industry Academia and the Civil sector um Manu of course was a crucial uh author on this paper as was Kim Duffy who I think is on the call.
[2024-11-12T17:15:57.546Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So I'll just briefly talk as I said I want to focus in this um in this call on what we see as the problem that person had credentials can respond to um and these are problems that we're seeing in the AI space then I'll give a an overview of our approach what we sort of outlined as a as as a A system that solves the problem we've identified.
[2024-11-12T17:16:01.972Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I will say upfront that this is not a particularly.
[2024-11-12T17:16:11.581Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Solution we don't offer a very specific concrete implementation that's not kind of the point of the paper the point of the paper was to.
[2024-11-12T17:16:17.563Z]	<Darius_Kazemi_(Harvard_ASML)>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:16:21.525Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Argue for the importance of this idea and to get people talking about it in a serious way and then as I said we'll focus on next steps.
[2024-11-12T17:17:04.152Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So this paper starts from a kind of basic observation but 1 that is increasingly alarming and AI policy circles which is that it's getting harder to tell if there's a person behind various kinds of activity on the internet um and this is because this is kind of for 2 reasons or 2 Trends in AI that are pushing in this direction the first is 1 that we roughly talk about as in indistinguishability it's becoming much easier for um to create content that is indistinguishable from Human content um and this is not just like.
[2024-11-12T17:17:35.120Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: You know highly uh highly persuasive text that sounds like it was written thoughtfully by some person and um but also avatars increasingly deep fakes and so forth and increasingly um actions can be taken around the Internet by AI agents in a way that makes them even their actions and distinguishable from the sorts of actions that um a human would take and by the and to think about this um.
[2024-11-12T17:17:35.514Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  you know think.
[2024-11-12T17:17:49.049Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: About some of the tools that have come out recently like in the last month anthropic released a computer using agent for example which clicks around the web um much like a human does.
[2024-11-12T17:17:52.992Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And at the same time as many people know.
[2024-11-12T17:18:13.046Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: The uh these AI tools are increasingly widely available their costs are decreasing and there's ton there are tons of accessible models um especially open weights models um are easily accessible to.
[2024-11-12T17:18:20.490Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Anyone with uh an ability to access the internet and figure out how to run them.
[2024-11-12T17:18:26.002Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: 1 of the observations that we really.
[2024-11-12T17:18:31.521Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Try to try to begin with is the person in credentials.
[2024-11-12T17:18:44.602Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: End up are end up looking like a solution that are that is highly that is robust to highly capable AI as in it provides a way of identifying.
[2024-11-12T17:19:31.810Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: When some activity is coming from from a person in a way that's robust to C highly capable Ai and also in a way that is privacy preserving and inclusive so those are kind of like the 3 der that we think about in this paper that we want a solution that allows us to sort of authenticate like anonymously activity on the internet but in a way that is privacy preserving and also inclusive so some of the other strategies that you might think about if you're trying to think about how to counter AI powered deception is you know you might think first of captures and browser challenges of various kinds or an anomaly detection systems.
[2024-11-12T17:19:34.516Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: What we want to argue here is.
[2024-11-12T17:19:48.540Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Those uh the existing approaches are not going to be robust to the kinds of tools that are coming out these days um other strategies that you might consider could be economic barriers for example.
[2024-11-12T17:19:53.505Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um you know this is what for example Twitter does right now.
[2024-11-12T17:20:06.015Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: In order to get an authentication a blue check mark you simply have to pay in some way um those approaches may work but they're not particularly inclusive.
[2024-11-12T17:20:13.030Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um in AI policy circles people talk a lot about synthetic content.
[2024-11-12T17:20:18.510Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Tools like watermarking and content provenance.
[2024-11-12T17:20:25.498Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Our argument is going to be the personhood credentials can really complement these sorts of approaches.
[2024-11-12T17:20:33.508Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And then you know another another possibility is that.
[2024-11-12T17:20:38.509Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: 1 way of telling who's a person online is to require a.
[2024-11-12T17:20:44.535Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Of verification through appearance-based and documents based.
[2024-11-12T17:20:58.529Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Verification processes like asking for a picture of a driver's license or you know now sometimes if you're doing some remote uh remote.
[2024-11-12T17:21:08.048Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: For example if you're starting a job and you have to do it remotely you'll do some kind of uh live video call to check that you are the person you say you are.
[2024-11-12T17:21:29.572Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Our argument is going to be that not only are these not particularly privacy preserving like there might be some solutions where it's way overboard to ask people to provide their identification or hop on a video call and say show exactly who they are.
[2024-11-12T17:21:53.070Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: But also these these Solutions are also not robust to highly capable AI it's getting increasingly easy to spoof a driver's license in a really convincing way um it's getting increasingly easy to use a video deep fake Avatar of some kind and get on a zoom call um using a likeness that is not your own.
[2024-11-12T17:22:04.620Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: What we're going to what we argue in the paper is that we need some kind of new Solutions and.
[2024-11-12T17:22:18.664Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Been so far slightly vague about what exactly we're trying to what kinds of AI powered deception we're really trying to prevent and to sort of fix ideas for all of you.
[2024-11-12T17:22:23.115Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I'll talk about just 3 kind of broad areas.
[2024-11-12T17:22:33.461Z]	<David_I._Lehn>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:22:47.249Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: 1 area you can think of as like reducing the impact of sock puppeting so people pretending to be someone they're not online and often malicious actors whether they're trying to do fraud or some kind of political manipulation will make many many profiles um that are supposedly representing a particular you know particular.
[2024-11-12T17:22:57.704Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Real people but in fact these are sock puppets um we also think about mitigating various kinds of Bot attacks so.
[2024-11-12T17:23:18.216Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: In a world where it's very cheap to send agents out in AI agents out into the web and make tons of accounts um we worry a lot about the various kinds of attacks that this could enable on um important Digital Services.
[2024-11-12T17:23:46.363Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um there's also a kind of more more futuristic though not that futuristic use case that we start thinking about in the paper and that is part of a broader open wide open question um about how these agents are going how these AI agents are going to work across the web and and how we're going to make sure that they are uh acting on behalf of real people.
[2024-11-12T17:23:58.279Z]	<Kim_Duffy>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:24:22.438Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And that is um we think the personhood credentials could be a a really valuable way of maintaining you know the anonymity of the internet that we hold dear in this world where AI agents are running around and doing things on people on humans behalf if there were no way of authenticating AI agents at all then we imagine we would see lots of scaled deception um and you know to a degree that could really overwhelm the internet um.
[2024-11-12T17:24:31.784Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: But with personhood credentials there could be a some really simple ways to at least verify that 1 an agent.
[2024-11-12T17:24:39.261Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Is acting they're acting on behalf of some person and you don't have to know which but some person.
[2024-11-12T17:24:51.275Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um so this uh new paradigm of agentic AI is really motivating um for a lot of the paper and happy to.
[2024-11-12T17:24:51.550Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  go into.
[2024-11-12T17:24:56.285Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: More on that when we get into the discussion later on.
[2024-11-12T17:25:08.314Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um as I said 1 of the big worries and again 1 of the things motivating a lot of us who worked on this paper is that we worry about a future where.
[2024-11-12T17:25:12.274Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: AI the the widespread use of AI makes.
[2024-11-12T17:25:34.874Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Digital Services so hard to use um they become so overwhelmed that people that service providers end up resorting to highly non-private methods of authentication um and you know some groups around the world are already trying to tie internet usage to personal.
[2024-11-12T17:25:43.234Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Identity in various ways and that's kind of like the the a a motivating.
[2024-11-12T17:25:49.814Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um a motivating bad case I'll say that.
[2024-11-12T17:25:54.769Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: That that partially we think person had credentials can help us to avoid.
[2024-11-12T17:26:01.150Z]	<Lara_Schull>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:26:28.914Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um and as I said I'm not sure how many of you have been paying close attention in the AI policy space but 1 of the major policy tools in in discussion right now are various kinds of content provenance um and maybe you guys are familiar with the content uh the ctpa group who are trying to come up with standards for making sure that there's a kind of standard way of.
[2024-11-12T17:26:38.355Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Providing a manifest you know a metadata manifests that says where various kinds of media came from.
[2024-11-12T17:27:08.926Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And what we want to suggest in this paper is that personhood credentials kind of are like very complimentary they take a different approach rather than trying to figure out whether some piece of AI media was produced or whether some piece of media was produced by an AI or a person we say well forget about the media itself let's think about the account or let's think about you know the user is that user a real person.
[2024-11-12T17:27:12.855Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So I'll go.
[2024-11-12T17:27:28.850Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Now through our approach to the problem which as I said at the beginning is kind of like a big picture um outline of the types of of the properties that we think a person had credential system should have.
[2024-11-12T17:27:36.830Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: We landed on 2 fundamental requirements of personhood credential systems.
[2024-11-12T17:27:55.316Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um I should also note that many of you may be familiar with the term proof of personhood which is in many ways essentially what we're describing we chose to use a different um a different term in this paper because proof of personhood.
[2024-11-12T17:28:15.358Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q+
[2024-11-12T17:28:19.367Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Varied and have taken on many different meanings in blockchain communities and so we wanted to be able to sort of create our own definition of like exactly what we mean when we talk about a personhood credential and so you know this does this does describe some existing systems.
[2024-11-12T17:28:23.818Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Systems that describe themselves as proof of personhood.
[2024-11-12T17:28:36.388Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Joy sorry to interject do you mind uh clarifying what's the difference between uh person who credential proof of personhood and proof of humanity know.
[2024-11-12T17:28:38.228Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q-
[2024-11-12T17:28:40.486Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um basically there's.
[2024-11-12T17:28:48.000Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: In this paper we wanted to outline a very specific set of requirements and definitions.
[2024-11-12T17:29:08.609Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: A personhood and proof of humanity don't actually have particularly specific definitions they tend to refer to a wide variety of protocols in you know vaguely associated with the blockchain space and so to distinguish ourselves from.
[2024-11-12T17:29:16.707Z]	<Geun-Hyung_Kim>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:29:20.636Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Them or just kind of make something a bit more specific we use this term personhood credentials so it's really just that we wanted to be able to uh make a concrete definition.
[2024-11-12T17:29:24.107Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Regardless of what is already out there.
[2024-11-12T17:29:35.640Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So the the core idea here is that.
[2024-11-12T17:29:37.972Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  the first.
[2024-11-12T17:29:45.169Z]	<Nicky_Hickman>	There are also 'proof of liveliness' checks in identity proofing processes that rely on pictures or videors
[2024-11-12T17:29:48.193Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: First foundational requirement of a of a person to credential system is that there has to be some method of limiting the number of credentials per user.
[2024-11-12T17:30:06.973Z]	<David_Waite>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:30:09.189Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um and specifically we say that there needs to be 1 credenza.
[2024-11-12T17:30:14.184Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: The second foundational requirement is on linkable pseudonymity.
[2024-11-12T17:30:40.807Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: This is our this is the kind of privacy that we think this this sort of system should aim for um this is 1 in which the user interacts with Services through some kind of service specific pseudonym and all of their activity is both untraceable by the issuer and also unlink across service providers even when the service providers collude with each other and with the issuer.
[2024-11-12T17:31:15.598Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So these are these are the uh the requirements that we think are most important for a personhood credential system obviously they're still vague and need to be filled in with more specificity um but there are protocols that satisfy these requirements in some way um obviously you know what it how well do they mitigate theft or transfer is always going to be a question um you're not going to be able to perfectly uh.
[2024-11-12T17:31:19.452Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: All of these things.
[2024-11-12T17:31:25.587Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And that's another another reason why we wanted to sort of distinguish ourselves a little bit from.
[2024-11-12T17:31:25.957Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  proof of.
[2024-11-12T17:31:31.279Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Personhood work is that often they have their own ideas about.
[2024-11-12T17:31:38.400Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Exactly uh you know what exactly the foundational requirements are and often.
[2024-11-12T17:31:43.905Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: They're aiming for a kind of extreme uniqueness.
[2024-11-12T17:31:58.078Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um where you know the the place in the trade-off that where they really put their weight is making sure that no person has has 2 um and they also sort of.
[2024-11-12T17:32:04.114Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Often have kind of global Ambitions and and want to.
[2024-11-12T17:32:04.536Z]	<Rashmi_Siravara>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:32:15.289Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And often sort of operate under the assumption that there would be only 1 issuer of of personhood credentials.
[2024-11-12T17:32:19.363Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: But we can talk more about all of that in the discussion.
[2024-11-12T17:32:29.518Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: For now what I'll highlight is the personhood credentials need to lean into what AI cannot and will not soon be able to do.
[2024-11-12T17:32:35.502Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I'm saying that they definitely can't.
[2024-11-12T17:32:41.980Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Right now and probably not for a while as they can't pass as a person in the real world.
[2024-11-12T17:32:45.470Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: We like to think about the.
[2024-11-12T17:32:45.704Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  person who.
[2024-11-12T17:32:55.503Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Credential is requiring some kind of offline component now that doesn't necessarily mean that a person has to show up.
[2024-11-12T17:32:55.678Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  you know.
[2024-11-12T17:33:18.053Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Live like as if they're showing up to the DMV to do some kind of in-person check it could be that they have some physical document like that's offline they have some physical document that you know itself required you know something like being born for example if if it's a birth certificate um.
[2024-11-12T17:33:26.017Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Or perhaps it's a driver's license which required at some point um taking a driver a driving test.
[2024-11-12T17:33:28.485Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So I guess what I'm saying here is.
[2024-11-12T17:33:44.617Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: There needs to be some kind of offline component in the phc issuance process but it doesn't have to necessarily be that the issuer is going to uh confront the the user in person themselves.
[2024-11-12T17:33:57.244Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I'll describe now the sort of enrollment and usage process that we have in mind here.
[2024-11-12T17:34:01.088Z]	<TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com)>	One PHC issuer to rule them all... seems like the UN might be the most likely (and that's not very) candidate.
[2024-11-12T17:34:21.923Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And again this is something that we can talk about more in the discussion to talk through specific ways that this could uh be implemented but the basic idea here is that the user there we like to imagine a world with many possible or multiple possible issuers not too many but a few um.
[2024-11-12T17:34:29.487Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Where the user is going to request their credential and provide a particular kind of evidence that the issuer asks for.
[2024-11-12T17:34:34.022Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Issuer is going to do some kind of validity check.
[2024-11-12T17:34:34.204Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  where they're.
[2024-11-12T17:34:37.745Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	I don't believe in one credential to rule them all :)
[2024-11-12T17:34:48.732Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: A is this are is the person in question actually a person and they're also doing some uniqueness check because remember there's this requirement of a credential limit 1 1.
[2024-11-12T17:34:53.736Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	what I'm not seeing on this diagram is any sort of revocation / conflict resolution mechanisms
[2024-11-12T17:34:55.193Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And then if both of those checks pass they hand over this personhood credential to the user.
[2024-11-12T17:35:00.702Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: We think of the user kind of holding their personhood credential in a digital wallet.
[2024-11-12T17:35:22.271Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And then they can use their their personhood credential around the web with various different applications um various different service providers and all the while it's very important they're not going to be revealing any details about their credentials so service providers will always be using.
[2024-11-12T17:35:32.249Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Kind of zero knowledge proof um possibly with a nullifier if it's important for the service provider to not allow duplicate accounts.
[2024-11-12T17:35:32.564Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  so you.
[2024-11-12T17:35:36.130Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Yes, this is one of the toughest parts of the problem... how many issuers, and should they (or should they not) collude to ensure 1 PHC per person. Or, how many sybils are acceptable in the system.
[2024-11-12T17:35:43.789Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: It might be that if we're thinking about the service provider as some social media platform like Twitter it might be the case that they want to try to enforce.
[2024-11-12T17:35:48.237Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Rule where each person has only 1 account.
[2024-11-12T17:35:57.741Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So in that case they could make some application specific pseudonym to ensure that they're not giving 1 user more than 1 account.
[2024-11-12T17:36:09.792Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Keep in mind there are multiple issuers so if we think through this you know let's imagine there are 2 different issuers 1 might be you know.
[2024-11-12T17:36:23.821Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Scanning some part of your body like a palm or an iris and issuing uh a personhood credential on the basis of of some kind of biometric scan.
[2024-11-12T17:36:28.735Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	How can we ensure 1 PHC per person?  For example, 1 person can have multiple devices, so does this mean that only 1 device could hold that PHC?
[2024-11-12T17:36:42.936Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Might also go to an issuer that's perhaps a government issue or who you know scans a driver's license and and without storing any details um or tying any details about my identity to my credential hands me a credential on the basis of this.
[2024-11-12T17:36:56.459Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:37:05.600Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So then I could be in a position where I have 2 credentials 1 1 that comes from um the biometric issuer and 1 that comes from some kind of government issuer and so clearly the in the system I would be able to get to social media accounts even um.
[2024-11-12T17:37:24.727Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: 2 authenticated social media accounts because I have 2 different credentials and basically what we're going to the position that we take in the paper and you know hap very happy to discuss this because I think we all had really valuable discussions about this in the course of writing the paper um.
[2024-11-12T17:37:25.183Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  to us.
[2024-11-12T17:37:39.141Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: That seems fine um it it seems like the the most important thing is being able to in some way limit activity rather than to enforce um a strong notion of uniqueness.
[2024-11-12T17:37:41.293Z]	<Nivas_S>	I have a question - how does the service provider trust the issuer is the right one and not a fake one? (Please bear with me if a silly question as I am a newbie in the domain)
[2024-11-12T17:37:52.191Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um so as I said 1 1 possible way of like achieving this offline component is to have to use some kind of zero knowledge proof of just holding a government ID without.
[2024-11-12T17:38:01.159Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Revealing which ID so the issuer could um and there are there are some early protocols like um.
[2024-11-12T17:38:06.308Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um Annan Adar for example that are.
[2024-11-12T17:38:11.753Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Regarding to do this on the base of basis of national uh.
[2024-11-12T17:38:16.163Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	@Nivas - not a silly question at all. it's the central and crucial question for anything to do with Verifiable Credentials.
[2024-11-12T17:38:21.603Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So as I said you know when I was highlighting the social media example.
[2024-11-12T17:38:28.817Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	and the answer is - we'll need Issuer registries. (and registries of registries)
[2024-11-12T17:38:30.240Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	@Nivas You need a trust framework
[2024-11-12T17:38:30.335Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um we favor we in the paper we sort of identified this kind of fundamental trade-off.
[2024-11-12T17:39:10.135Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Sorry something happened to my student we identify these sorts of fundamental trade-offs between systems that have 1 creds systems that have unlimited credentials and systems that have bounded credentials so as I said we favor this approach where there are multiple issuers so it is possible you know you're not going to fully prevent a kind of civil attack but you will really limit the scope of those attacks because there will be a small finite number of potential trusted issuers.
[2024-11-12T17:39:20.911Z]	<Nivas_S>	@Dmitri and @Harrison - Is this what the GAN (Global acceptance network) is all about?
[2024-11-12T17:39:25.221Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And so this trade-off that we described here is that you know of course if you can the the very best way to counter scalable AI based deception would be to do something like you know.
[2024-11-12T17:39:28.210Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Where where there's some like.
[2024-11-12T17:39:36.255Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Database that has everyone's Anonymous um Anonymous a person had credentials in it.
[2024-11-12T17:39:38.283Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Think that this is.
[2024-11-12T17:39:54.301Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Bad type of solution from the perspective of privacy and civil liberties I mean I definitely don't have to say that you know I don't probably don't have to convince this group that that's um for many reasons a A system that would.
[2024-11-12T17:39:55.741Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	@Nivas Yes.  And we will have Drummond to present and talk about GAN next year.
[2024-11-12T17:39:58.316Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: To uh potentially very bad outcomes.
[2024-11-12T17:40:35.395Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: But at the same time what we're suggesting here is that if you have no method of limiting the activity online then you really lose out on your ability to counter scalable deception to the degree which you may actually so we may actually see so much overwhelming activity on the internet that people resort to to certain kinds of um aggressive privacy invasive approaches so that's why we we see a bounded credential ecosystem as 1 that.
[2024-11-12T17:40:44.397Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Uh balances this trade-off between protecting privacy and civil liberties while also countering scalable deception.
[2024-11-12T17:40:50.100Z]	<TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com)>	oh, I think I see... I missed the part where "per issuer" means multiple *PHC* issuers can be in play. Perhaps one from regional govt, another from employer, another from NGO membership organization...
[2024-11-12T17:41:01.022Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um and on that note as I'm talking about these trade-offs of course any phc system is going to be a sociotechnical system that has to be carefully uh designed and care and many implementation challenges have to be considered such as.
[2024-11-12T17:41:18.591Z]	<Nivas_S>	@Harrison Thank you for the answers and clarification
[2024-11-12T17:41:28.084Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: All these uh how these credentials might end up impacting access to Digital Services how they impact people's feelings of of safety and and confidence and free expression um of course there's a there are questions about the power dynamics of Digital Services and the degree to which different phc systems are vulnerable to mistakes and intentional subversion by different actors.
[2024-11-12T17:41:34.025Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And you know these are all the big questions we believe that there are.
[2024-11-12T17:41:34.137Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  you know.
[2024-11-12T17:41:35.782Z]	<Drummond_Reed_(iPad)>	GAN is super interested in PHCs. We have several of us attending this call. Really love this paper.
[2024-11-12T17:41:41.303Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	Yep, Ted, that's one of the open questions -- how many issuers are enough? (in all the senses of "enough")
[2024-11-12T17:41:42.114Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: If we if we all start if we all put our heads together and start thinking about this really really carefully and thoughtfully we believe that.
[2024-11-12T17:41:47.013Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Ways to implement phc systems that would um.
[2024-11-12T17:41:53.538Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Maintain Equitable access and free expression and checks on Power and be robust to to attack an error.
[2024-11-12T17:42:23.889Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So with that um in the paper we outline a wide range of next steps in um for governments and technologists and standards bodies and you know public consultation will be a very important part of socializing this idea uh you can't be a it can't be a solution that comes from the top down people need to understand the cryptography they need to understand why it's valuable um.
[2024-11-12T17:42:35.929Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And so we talked about ways in which we can adapt existing digital systems and also prioritize person and credentials through policy and um technology.
[2024-11-12T17:42:38.317Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  in particular.
[2024-11-12T17:42:40.127Z]	<Darius_Kazemi_(Harvard_ASML)>	also how does one become an issuer, how hard is it, how much money and time does it cost, etc. looking at SSL issuers might be instructive re: where this fails/succeeds
[2024-11-12T17:42:40.260Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  this is where.
[2024-11-12T17:42:53.441Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: I'll stop so that we have plenty of time for discussion but I know that this group has particular um skills and perspectives to offer and we'd be super excited to hear.
[2024-11-12T17:42:53.720Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  what your.
[2024-11-12T17:43:02.468Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Reactions are I mean I think 1 1 very clear next step is to move towards some more Concrete technical.
[2024-11-12T17:43:25.577Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Ations um and you know potentially the this group might be interested in spinning off another kind of working group on personhood credentials in particular or maybe it fits into an existing initiative to um try to make these ideas more concrete and to bring them to a wider audience.
[2024-11-12T17:43:45.705Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: So I'll stop there and yeah let's let's do discussion I mean we can format it as Q&A my um my co-author Stevens here too and Kim and Manu I want all of us to you know be part of the discussion.
[2024-11-12T17:43:48.020Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	ack manu
[2024-11-12T17:44:21.618Z]	<Olvis_E._Gil_Ríos>	Hello! My name is Olvis E. Gil Ríos, founder of OG Technologies EU, I am currently working on blockchain standards for cross-border payments using DIDs/VCs.  Very interesting presentation! My question is: How can developers interested in building on PHC learn more?
[2024-11-12T17:44:40.561Z]	<Kim_Duffy>	+1,
[2024-11-12T17:44:48.556Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah um thank you Zoe that was like uh that was awesome um uh thank you for you know uh taking the time and presenting it to the group and I know as you said this group is like super interested in the work in really wants to see it um uh uh be realized right so um I guess the you know the the question is like you know where do we go from here and what do we do um I also before going to that though I also want to kind of point out to the rest of the group that um uh uh Stephen and Zoe in shrey have been like absolutely amazing and awesome through this entire like exercise like this has been going on for you know uh uh 2 plus years a year plus in there are some of the best Bridge builders that I've seen operate across like all these different groups being people together to kind of work on this problem um so you know if you're interested in working on this stuff I can't.
[2024-11-12T17:44:49.735Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  more highly recommend.
[2024-11-12T17:44:49.853Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: And you know working.
[2024-11-12T17:45:50.532Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: With uh Stephen and Zoe um you know on this stuff um that said there you know we have seen signals this is mostly for like you know uh so in Stephen we've seen signals where like people are already starting to work on this stuff like they read the paper and they're kind of like uh charging for it so like just last week I think uh Kim you you have more details on this but like there are a number of people at D that have gotten together uh to create a vocabulary where meaning like a way of digitally expressing this credential where a subset of it is around a personhood credential in last week we talked about like hey we need to get this thing you know in front of uh you know uh Stephen Zoe get their thoughts on it and then try to put like an actual like actually issue 1 of these credentials in like a um in like a a playground setting and and just get the technology kind of sorted out um I'm interested in.
[2024-11-12T17:45:51.204Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  hearing from.
[2024-11-12T17:45:51.756Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: In the community.
[2024-11-12T17:46:07.008Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Where else you know work is happening I know Drummond said that there's some stuff that's going on uh in gain uh as well so so yeah really interested in hearing about like other places people have seen personhood credentials.
[2024-11-12T17:46:09.480Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Pop up as like.
[2024-11-12T17:46:15.034Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: You know forming real real things uh that's.
[2024-11-12T17:46:18.106Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: On your next in the queue.
[2024-11-12T17:46:27.417Z]	<andor>	https://github.com/andorsk/awesome-proof-of-personhood
[2024-11-12T17:46:36.253Z]	<Transcriber>	andor: Yeah I think I think first of all fantastic presentation thank you so much um actually Manu your your points really well noted right here I'm going to point in a link I started after this paper indexing personage credentials and or uh just person who uh sort of methodologies and types and just uh we need to remove it in depth.
[2024-11-12T17:46:49.746Z]	<Transcriber>	andor: So if anybody would like to contribute or help adding to the index I think that'd be really appreciated um so uh feel free to I just sent the link on the uh chats and uh would appreciate um people pushing in their their projects so thank you.
[2024-11-12T17:46:58.772Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And also there's a a question in the chat how can developers interested in building on PHT learn more.
[2024-11-12T17:47:04.251Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: So I I I think some of you guys already kind of talked about the anything else that.
[2024-11-12T17:47:11.776Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: This page from indoors seems like a great place to start.
[2024-11-12T17:47:15.776Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: That was that was what I was gonna say so.
[2024-11-12T17:47:20.767Z]	<Olvis_E._Gil_Ríos>	Thank you!
[2024-11-12T17:47:21.663Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Great cool uh dimitry.
[2024-11-12T17:47:29.003Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah I wanted to ask if the if openai or the paper authors uh.
[2024-11-12T17:47:39.497Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Have thought about a uh revocation and conflict resolution architecture.
[2024-11-12T17:47:52.050Z]	<Drummond_Reed>	present+
[2024-11-12T17:47:58.022Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh because as we all know verifiable credentials are great against being forged or stolen but offer no protection against being voluntarily shared or you know uh shared for for money Etc and so I'm curious uh uh if any thought went into the.
[2024-11-12T17:48:03.493Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh reporting moderation and conflict resolution side of the credentials.
[2024-11-12T17:48:06.871Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q+
[2024-11-12T17:48:32.590Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Yeah I I 1 Thing also and others can feel free to jump in as the 1 perspective that we came to and writing this paper was that in some ways of course theft and or sharing a credentials selling a credential is a huge issue and especially in a world with multiple issuers you know people might have more incentives to.
[2024-11-12T17:48:36.051Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: S or to um.
[2024-11-12T17:48:41.973Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Or to uh uh sell them in some way.
[2024-11-12T17:48:56.110Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: These sort of came to the came to the view in this paper and and others can can correct me if this is not a representation of your view but I I came to the view that to some degree it's.
[2024-11-12T17:49:19.106Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Okay cost to not have um you know to have these systems be occasionally sold or stolen or or shared and part of that is that 1 of the big as I focused on in in the in in the problem statement.
[2024-11-12T17:49:38.458Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	q+ to note how "sharing credentials" can be partially mitigated via BBS pseudonyms.
[2024-11-12T17:49:46.747Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: We're really talking about scalable AI deception and to some degree just being able to put a limit on things is incredibly valuable so even if it's not really that you know this person had credentials like exactly given to who it uh you know is that is exactly being used by the person who it was issued to there's still this sense in which the overall activity.
[2024-11-12T17:49:52.068Z]	<Greg_Bernstein>	Pseudonyms can help put a limit on things.
[2024-11-12T17:50:03.728Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: And overall like fraudulent activity in the system is largely reduced um and that said we also um in terms of the actual thinking in the paper so so that's 1 part of my answer is like just some degree you know.
[2024-11-12T17:50:12.196Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: You're right and we kind of take the view that it's okay to some degree because there's still this overall limit.
[2024-11-12T17:50:36.782Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Um in the paper we also talked a bit about um revocation and recovery and reau reauthentication kind of taking the view that you know of course it's inconvenient to have to reauthenticate frequently but we would tend to favor tighter expiration limits generally for this reason exactly um.
[2024-11-12T17:50:46.879Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: While it's not like perfect and we can't transfer like we can't prevent people from transferring our our selling you know tight expiration limits would go a large.
[2024-11-12T17:50:47.129Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig:  a large.
[2024-11-12T17:50:48.383Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Part of the way.
[2024-11-12T17:50:58.532Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I uh if I if I could clarify specifically meant uh sharing with AI is not with people uh does that does your answer still apply to that.
[2024-11-12T17:51:05.469Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Yeah and um the answer still applies and I think that you know again.
[2024-11-12T17:51:23.901Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: 1 of the 1 of the sort of positive use cases that we talked about in the paper is this idea of verified delegation so yeah sure you know give your credential to an AI agent but you know again you'll only really be able to.
[2024-11-12T17:51:24.533Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Will still be.
[2024-11-12T17:51:29.933Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Pretty Limited in you know the number of AI agents that you could give your credential to.
[2024-11-12T17:51:33.136Z]	<Transcriber>	Steven_Adler: Make mad on.
[2024-11-12T17:51:54.435Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	I'm not sure I see the part that would limit how many malicious AI agents I could share my PHC with
[2024-11-12T17:52:08.309Z]	<Transcriber>	Steven_Adler: Yeah um yeah I I think what's always said is totally correct like I we we did not go so far as to lay out uh an architecture I would say for Recovery or revocation those certainly we recognize that they are like important and useful um but also maybe less critical than sometimes understood and so in the case of AI like Zoe Zoe is alluding to you know if a dating app has a rule that you may not delegate your account to an AI system uh and you decide to do it anyway right you do it illicitly.
[2024-11-12T17:52:39.704Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	@Steven - I see, so you're envisioning per-application revocation mechanisms, rather than part of the infrastructure
[2024-11-12T17:52:50.245Z]	<Transcriber>	Steven_Adler: You know you're violating the terms of service it's not great uh if the site determines that you've done it they can actually now just you they can suspend your account and you can't create another 1 and so there is a pretty natural bound on what you can do um and likewise you wouldn't be able to use your credential to power 20 accounts on the platform or do fishing at scale or things um to to the extent that uh the platform decides that they want to limit to a certain number of accounts per credential so hopefully that illustrates how you you can still do elicit sharing in various ways but at significantly lower impact than maybe in other systems.
[2024-11-12T17:53:15.106Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Yeah and I just tagged yeah thank you Stephen that's really helpful clarification and I I would just tack on that this is another kind of it may be subtle but it is another sort of difference from what we typically think of as like proof of personhood protocols which really do care a lot about the uh credential only being used by the person it was issued to like we're a little.
[2024-11-12T17:53:19.523Z]	<Transcriber>	zoë_hitzig: Uh our view is a little looser than that.
[2024-11-12T17:53:21.895Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Money do you want to add to that.
[2024-11-12T17:53:24.158Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	ack manu
[2024-11-12T17:53:25.709Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Um sure yeah uh.
[2024-11-12T17:53:26.067Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  I I think.
[2024-11-12T17:53:34.738Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q-
[2024-11-12T17:54:26.673Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yes so plus 1 to what you know um uh Zoe and Stephen have already said um I I'm pointing out something that Gregg Bernstein who's been working on the BBS pseudonym stuff uh pointed out in the chat Channel um so you know this community knows that there's no such thing as a perfect security system there will always be uh security failures in any any system that you that you build right so um we are expecting a certain amount of cables in the system it's just a natural consequence of uh the balance that we're trying to uh strike uh I think Demetri your point is like how do you make it so the syllables don't make it so that the system itself falls apart like there's a certain level of fraud in a system that leads to system failure and we don't want to go past that line so um uh so there are a number of variables here right um we don't want 1 Uber issuer that there's only 1 you know you the United Nations of personhood credentials and there's only.
[2024-11-12T17:54:27.793Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  1 of those in the world.

Moreso than revocation though, a service-provider can just 'burn' a credential for their service once it's used, independent of revoking

<div onmouseout="$('#link-46').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-46').show()" id="46" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  That&apos;s the problem we&apos;re trying to solve linkability being able to use these identifiers to track someone inadvertently um or by you know a bad actor. <a id="link-46" style="display:none;" href="#46">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-54').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-54').show()" id="54" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  But 1 of the problems is called verifier verifier collusion if you read some of the feedback to the Department of Homeland Security&apos;s request for comment for the mdl um there have been some responses calling out verifier verifier Collision explicitly and the problem is like this where you&apos;re trying to share your information with a bank might be a different set of information than what you would share to a Content website that&apos;s hated um whether or not those are good ideas to have as policy in the first place totally separate topic right but it is true that there are some laws that do require it now for certain content and for banking regulations. <a id="link-54" style="display:none;" href="#54">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-55').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-55').show()" id="55" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  Knowing that we exist in that set of requirements um the bank might need to know your full name and your exact date of birth the content website might only need to know if you&apos;re over a certain age right so those are different sets of data. <a id="link-55" style="display:none;" href="#55">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-56').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-56').show()" id="56" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  And 1 common gotcha when implementing these systems is recycling these unique values such as digital signatures when you&apos;re showing things to the bank and content websites right so this uh in this world the content website might be able or content websites plural right might be able to retain the signature because you&apos;ve gone and disclosed it as part of the verification process and the bank might get the same signature even though you shared different data sets with each party it may be possible for the bank to I don&apos;t know purchase the data from the content websites or there could be a coercive Force many issuers tend to have a power imbalance when it comes to the verifiers and they might have some coercion power right so there are many ways for this to create surveillance potential meaning that 1 day it might be used to tie together activity to an individual right and um basically uh that can create a bunch of unintended social consequences not only violations of privacy but the you know knock-on effects of. <a id="link-56" style="display:none;" href="#56">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-84').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-84').show()" id="84" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  So that it would only be encrypted inputs to the te going in and then you would get encrypted outputs to the user&apos;s device coming out and then the issuer would be none the wiser and the holder would have uh a proof of computation happening in the te so the trust model uh shifts from just the issuer to they trust the issuer and they also trust them Hardware manufacturer of the te um that it has not been tampered with and we&apos;ll go into some considerations around where that assumption might not hold but um that&apos;s the general idea again we&apos;re looking for something that can uh help us uh with existing systems today without uh necessarily changing any of the cryptography but could be Quant post-quantum compatible going forward and uh requires a small upgrade in 1 of the components to add on linkability as opposed to again trying to rethink it wholesale which is difficult not from the technology side necessarily. <a id="link-84" style="display:none;" href="#84">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-133').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-133').show()" id="133" class="information">Harrison_Tang: To further clarify because I&apos;m not super familiar with how te works but in this uh proposal basically the issue or does not know the public key of the device itself the only the T its public key private key uh uh of the device it&apos;s all protected within the te so all all the issuer knows is the the signature that that gets computed from the from the key is that is that correct or. <a id="link-133" style="display:none;" href="#133">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-134').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-134').show()" id="134" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  Um so the um the issuer doesn&apos;t even know the signature coming out um so and you&apos;re correct that the all the user unique values from their device including um maybe a device key would be encrypted uh to the te uh many teas have functionality where there&apos;s a key that only they can access right it&apos;s because it&apos;s protected in the same Enclave for environment. <a id="link-134" style="display:none;" href="#134">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-145').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-145').show()" id="145" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  Yep that&apos;s fair so you&apos;re asking the te to finish issuing this credential and the te says to you issuer you know I need these things from you okay I&apos;m gonna expect these other things from the user but you&apos;re not going to hear about it and I think 1 of the nice considerations of this model is that um you know in some future iteration the te host doesn&apos;t even need to be the same entity as the issuer right so if there&apos;s a common entity that you both trust or something that&apos;s running a strong root program to for public key infrastructure then you might designate them as uh you know managing the cryptographic attestation of issuer data. <a id="link-145" style="display:none;" href="#145">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-146').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-146').show()" id="146" class="information">Harrison_Tang: Sorry a quick clarification question Wayne so so the verifier has to have the public key of the issuers to really uh to to verify the signature right so uh if the issuer doesn&apos;t even know uh these uh Keys then how how does the verify uh can how can the verify ensure that it&apos;s actually verifying uh the credentials from the from the issuers from from the intended issuer. <a id="link-146" style="display:none;" href="#146">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-147').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-147').show()" id="147" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  Yep great question um so the the issuer would still disclose its public key or its root key um the public part of it of course um and that would be included in you know a trust framework so that if a signature is created by this uh the private part of that key then we know it&apos;s from the issuer right so um that part is still shared with the verifiers and you could use something like did web or otherwise to establish that but the point is that the actual signatures as part of the credentials are not retained so the issuer is none the wiser. <a id="link-147" style="display:none;" href="#147">✪</a></div>

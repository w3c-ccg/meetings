Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Welcome everyone to this week's Wii meeting so 
  this week uh very excited to have Wayne Wayne Chong uh the 
  co-founder and CEO of spruce ID and the former culture of w3c ccg 
  uh to lead the discussion on provably forgotten signatures uh I 
  think he sent out uh that well written uh loan block blog post to 
  the email list about 2 months ago and we're very glad uh for him 
  to take the time to jump on and leave that discussion.
Harrison_Tang: Um but before we start just want to quickly go 
  through some administrative uh agendas uh first of all just a 
  quick reminder on the code of ethics and professional conduct um 
  just want to make sure that we have uh and continue to have 
  constructive uh and respectful conversations.
Harrison_Tang: A quick note on the intellectual property uh 
  anyone can participate in these calls however all substantive 
  contributions to any ccg work items must be the member of the ccg 
  with full IPR agreements signed.
Harrison_Tang: If you have any questions in regards to the 
  getting a w3c account or the community contributor license 
  agreement uh just in any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang: A couple quick call notes these meetings are 
  automatically recorded and transcribed as you can see here and 
  we'll try to uh publish them uh the transcription the audio 
  recording and the video recording in the next 1 or 2 days I think 
  we have been pretty diligent uh in publishing that within the 24 
  hours so uh we'll continue to do that um we use GG chat to cure 
  the speakers uh during the call so if you have any questions just 
  type in Q Plus to add yourself to the queue or cue minus to 
  remove.
Harrison_Tang: Next I just want to take a moment uh for people 
  who are new to the community or.
Harrison_Tang:  who have.
Harrison_Tang: Being active and want to re-engage uh just want to 
  take a quick moment for the introductions and reintroduction so.
Harrison_Tang: If you want to say a few words uh feel free to 
  just uh unmute and.
Harrison_Tang: And introduce yourself.
Harrison_Tang: I see mostly familiar faces so we'll move to.
Harrison_Tang: The next agenda item uh any announcements or 
  reminders.
Manu Sporny:  Uh yeah just a quick 1 um we announced this on the 
  mailing list but we have a new specification out uh which is VC's 
  over uh over Wireless.
<manu_sporny> VC Over Wireless: 
  https://digitalbazaar.github.io/vc-wireless/
Manu Sporny:  And I'll put the link.
Manu Sporny:  Uh in the chat Channel there um basically uh in 
  just a a share real quick um basically what this specification 
  does is it allows the transmission of verifiable credentials uh 
  over uh Wireless protocols like uh Bluetooth um or NFC uh it's 
  pretty fast uh there's a quick demo that we put to the mailing 
  list and this is just using 2 phones using a verifiable 
  credential where you literally just tap the phones together for 
  half a second and you get a VC transferred across um we'll be 
  adding uh support for this uh over the next couple of uh weeks to 
  the VC playground uh so that other people in the community can 
  play around with the technology.
Manu Sporny:  That's it from us.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man any other announcements or 
  reminders.
Harrison_Tang: A quick note uh so next week uh we will not have a 
  ccg meeting uh because uh the W3 CT pack uh 2024 so so we will 
  skip next week and then the week after that we'll resume the 
  meeting with uh.
Harrison_Tang: With the topic around signing NGS and 
  authentication ngi uh NGS ILP so.
Harrison_Tang: Resume that uh on October 1st or skip that next 
  Tuesday.
Harrison_Tang: Any uh other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any uh topics uh and updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: On you please.
Manu Sporny:  Uh yeah I mean the probably the easiest thing that 
  we might do is just um sort them by activity in cut them off um 
  you know based on like if there hasn't been any activity in the 
  last 3 months they just don't show up on the list of active 
  things the group is working on um and activity could be anything 
  from like new comments uh and you know on issues um you know PRS 
  that sort of thing I think that would cut that list down uh 
  pretty significantly and would help us get kind of a better view 
  on what's active and what's not just a suggestion though.
Manu Sporny:  I mean I can speak to the credential refresh stuff 
  that's not done um I think there there are a number of these that 
  go into hibernation for like 3 to 6 months at a time while the 
  people working on them work on something else higher priority um 
  and you know I there there are situations where that you know 
  there there's a there's a question on like should we archive some 
  of these repos and that's a much longer discussion right because 
  we've got like a hundred you know a hundred of them that that 
  we're gonna have to have discussions with the people that that 
  opened them um.
Manu Sporny:  Depends on you know depends on how much cleanup you 
  want to do we we might get quite far by just um.
Manu Sporny:  Focusing on you know things that have been updated 
  in the last 6 months and those are.
<dmitri_zagidulin> it's all fun & games & hybernation, until 
  somebody gets a grant or an S.O.W. then - furious action
Manu Sporny:  Better or Worse the things that the the community 
  is you know focusing on um.
<manu_sporny> haha, so true, Dmitri ^
Harrison_Tang: And then by the way we'll have another uh work 
  item updates and the Q4 review uh in at the end of November so so 
  we'll have uh I think last time we have a great discussion uh 
  around the work items updates uh will have another 1 uh in Q4.
Harrison_Tang: All right any other uh topics in regards to the 
  work items.
Harrison_Tang: Calls for introductions announcements and work 
  items.
Harrison_Tang: All right so that's uh get to the main agenda uh 
  again very excited to have Wayne uh come here and present um 
  briefly forgotten signatures uh I think I've uh.
Harrison_Tang: Now the link in regards to the his recent blog 
  post uh but uh I'll kind of yield the floor to him to uh really 
  go through his ideas and then lead a discussion is because I 
  think uh this topic is something that a lot of us really care 
  about or are interested to learn more about so blank thanks for 
  taking time here and the floor is yours.
https://blog-spruceid-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/blog.spruceid.com/provably-forgotten-signatures-adding-privacy-to-digital-identity/amp/
Wayne Chang:  Harrison thanks so much for the invitation here and 
  for giving some space to talk about this important topic it's 
  awesome to see so many bases old and new uh or at least profile 
  avatars and um it's great to be back here uh I'm here to talk 
  about proof will be forgot signatures I will start sharing my 
  screen so that you can see I just have to.
Wayne Chang:  Move this to present mode.
Wayne Chang:  Will be sharing this.
Wayne Chang:  Window sorry I'm just looking for.
Wayne Chang:  Okay great so can you confirm that you can see my 
  screen.
Wayne Chang:  Very good so I'm here to talk about a topic called 
  privileged forgot signatures it's a way that we can add privacy 
  to many of the digital credential and identity systems coming out 
  uh a little bit about me my name is Wayne Chang as Harrison 
  mentioned um I was a former ccg co-chair a really amazing group I 
  got pulled away by some work responsibilities unfortunately so 
  it's been hard for me to make this uh time slot but you know 
  really appreciate being here my background is an engineering and 
  product management I'm the founder and CEO of screw ID and I'm an 
  advocate for utility security privacy and interoperability um at 
  the company that's how we make a lot of our decisions is this 
  going to be useful for people just the most important question 
  can we do it safely and securely and privately and is going to 
  work with other Solutions out there uh to prevent lock in so that 
  you can let the market do its thing in a constructive way and 
  we've been working with public sector customers and also 
  institutions uh for a while so you tend to adopt a lot of the 
  challenges that your customers have when you're solving problem.
Wayne Chang:   Problems for them.
Wayne Chang:  This is where we thought a lot of.
Wayne Chang:  Privacy in the context of State identity and other 
  things.
Wayne Chang:  So the main problem that um you know you've 
  probably heard of or thought about is um this idea of linkability 
  that as you use these digital credentials in the wild to prove 
  things like age or you know residency or anything you can think 
  of right maybe there are these unique identifiers that are flying 
  around and there could be some surveillance Potential from those 
  right just unintended consequences of moving to digital systems 
  right um if you are to use a physical license or something right 
  and show it around sometimes the bartender will glance at it and 
  just kind of move on uh maybe the hotel staff will look at it and 
  uh you know move on sometimes they creepily make a photo copy but 
  that's a different uh you know topic um but when we move to 
  digital systems that have all these unique identifiers everything 
  from literal unique identifiers to digital signatures that are 
  for all intents and purposes you need.
Wayne Chang:  To create some tracking potential right and we're 
  going to talk about how these uh arise in different production 
  systems and some ways that people have thought about mitigating 
  them and also presenting an approach that can work in some pretty 
  I call it um lockdown constraints.
Wayne Chang:  That's the problem we're trying to solve 
  linkability being able to use these identifiers to track someone 
  inadvertently um or by you know a bad actor.
Wayne Chang:  And uh eliminating surveillance potential.
Wayne Chang:  So why does this matter why do we have to think 
  about it this way there's a lot of digital systems booting up but 
  I'm sure you've seen the news of different states enabling the 
  mobile driver's license in the US uh the EU architectural 
  reference framework is talking about uh European commission 
  member states uh having programs live in production by 2026 right 
  um looking at research by nist that will standardize for the 
  industry how do you send these things over the Internet um and 
  just there are a lot of prolific digital identity systems out 
  there today such as that hard for example so um really in the 
  past like 1 to 2 years the momentum has increased for this kind 
  of stuff uh and adoption is increasing as a result too um so uh 
  more specifically uh a lot of advocates for privacy and user 
  Freedom have talked a lot about the potential of um you know how 
  can we produce the maximum privacy right there are discus.
Wayne Chang:   Discussions with cryptograph.
Wayne Chang:  ERS and privacy Advocates and.
Wayne Chang:  A whole bunch of.
Wayne Chang:  Um you know what additional privacy protections can 
  we build into the protocol because um it's much more convenient 
  to be able to um just know that it works at the protocol level 
  and the stuff is impossible to link back versus uh kind of moving 
  to a model where you're trusting a bunch of intermediaries to uh 
  you know uh Delete the stuff properly or everything else right 
  so.
Wayne Chang:  Going to go over some of the problems and solutions 
  that have been proposed.
Wayne Chang:  But 1 of the problems is called verifier verifier 
  collusion if you read some of the feedback to the Department of 
  Homeland Security's request for comment for the mdl um there have 
  been some responses calling out verifier verifier Collision 
  explicitly and the problem is like this where you're trying to 
  share your information with a bank might be a different set of 
  information than what you would share to a Content website that's 
  hated um whether or not those are good ideas to have as policy in 
  the first place totally separate topic right but it is true that 
  there are some laws that do require it now for certain content 
  and for banking regulations.
Wayne Chang:  Knowing that we exist in that set of requirements 
  um the bank might need to know your full name and your exact date 
  of birth the content website might only need to know if you're 
  over a certain age right so those are different sets of data.
Wayne Chang:  And 1 common gotcha when implementing these systems 
  is recycling these unique values such as digital signatures when 
  you're showing things to the bank and content websites right so 
  this uh in this world the content website might be able or 
  content websites plural right might be able to retain the 
  signature because you've gone and disclosed it as part of the 
  verification process and the bank might get the same signature 
  even though you shared different data sets with each party it may 
  be possible for the bank to I don't know purchase the data from 
  the content websites or there could be a coercive Force many 
  issuers tend to have a power imbalance when it comes to the 
  verifiers and they might have some coercion power right so there 
  are many ways for this to create surveillance potential meaning 
  that 1 day it might be used to tie together activity to an 
  individual right and um basically uh that can create a bunch of 
  unintended social consequences not only violations of privacy but 
  the you know knock-on effects of.
Wayne Chang:   That can the.
Wayne Chang:  Make a different credit.
Wayne Chang:  You know basically.
Wayne Chang:  Right these are some uh pretty uh profound social 
  implications for it and um we think that potentially the 
  responsible thing to do here is just make the interactions how 
  they were as much as possible in the physical world so that V 
  that expectations are not violated right so um some ways that 
  people have approached to solving this is to just make more 
  signatures and different unique values that are basically 1-time 
  use it's less efficient um because you have to make a whole bunch 
  of these things and then you have to remember to discard the 
  signatures after you use them in the wallet or accept some kind 
  of probabilistic risk but it is a way to get rid of this specific 
  kind of collusion uh I believe this is how some mdl wallets are 
  implementing it uh today in production uh where you have a 
  different signature cycle per use.
Wayne Chang:  So another um trickier form of collusion which is a 
  lot of the topics that people talk about is this issue or verify 
  or collusion so let's say we use different signatures from um you 
  know different uh relying parties or verifiers right so we we're 
  trying to get rid of verify or verify our collusion with that and 
  let's say we've successfully done so um well there's another 
  thing to consider here.
Wayne Chang:  If you are sharing the signatures at all right and 
  the issuer is to retain the signatures uh then basically uh the 
  issuer could still 1 day you know surface those signatures even 
  if you just shared over 18 right if the issuer keeps good records 
  of uh what signatures they issued for what individuals in their 
  system right this might be a state Authority or it might be an 
  Enterprise or something um then 1 day the issuer could 
  potentially match these up right so this is also um why like you 
  know posting signatures in the public comes with certain uh 
  expectations right because if signature is to retain the 
  signature sorry if the issuer is to retain the signatures and you 
  create sort of these uh unique values and you put them in places 
  1 day if the issuer is to learn about those signatures or someone 
  is able to combine the data sets then they might have a really 
  good record of you know the usage going on right so that's.
Wayne Chang:   The issue.
Wayne Chang:  Or verify collusion.
Wayne Chang:  Can't just make more signatures of the same kind 
  for this 1 to solve it um you need to consider other options.
Wayne Chang:  We're going to review some options that people have 
  proposed which are valid options um.
Wayne Chang:  1 Is using zero knowledge proofs which I'm sure 
  that you've heard a bunch about especially the BBS Signature 
  suites there have also been a non-red you prove ZK snarks and ZK 
  snarks all of them have different properties but they roughly 
  want to do the same thing they want to just demonstrate the 
  minimal level of disclosure possible uh to prove the checkpoint 
  and you're on your way right so that is from the right issuer 
  without even disclosing a signature that you're over 18 without 
  disclosing and a date of birth right um so these I think are 
  probably the solution of the future and where we should look 
  towards but there are some areas that we have to consider uh when 
  you're trying to implement systems for um States institutions and 
  highly regulated entities right that these things are challenging 
  to implement and get certified.
Wayne Chang:  1 Of the.
Wayne Chang:  A big areas of challenge are compliance with the 
  federal information processing standards um so none of these uh 
  to my knowledge uh the elliptic zero knowledge proof based uh 
  Technologies including BBS uh are not considered uh you know nist 
  recommended and what happens with the nist recommended curves is 
  that they eventually make their way into Hardware security 
  modules which meet certain standards of physical and controls 
  based security to have a cryptographic module in the system it 
  makes a lot of sense from the security perspective because if 
  you're issuing state level identity right you want to meet 
  certain qualifications for the hardware that's doing the key 
  management right so that's just generally a good idea to have 
  that level of security but uh we see that the BLS curve for 
  example is not Nest recommended um and a lot of the other curves 
  um.
Wayne Chang:   Uh and.
Wayne Chang:  We think that a lot of.
Wayne Chang:  IC based cryptography um used for the current zero 
  knowledge work will not become a standards track uh Technologies 
  anytime soon or potentially at all because a lot of the air has 
  been sucked out of the room to focus on post-quantum resistant 
  cryptography right in the elliptic curves uh have not 
  demonstrated be practical in that use case.
Wayne Chang:  So I think that there are some zero knowledge 
  systems that are based on hashes uh that can be post-quantum 
  resistant but I'd say that they're pretty experimental at this 
  point and uh there is a growing industry shift away from many of 
  the items mentioned above for example I believe that uh a non-red 
  and you proof are both based on RSA and because of how easily 
  quantum computers can Factor uh large primes uh there's been a 
  shift away from RSA signatures in general which those things are 
  based on right and then if we're also seeing less popularity for 
  elliptic curves as the new nist recommended post-quantum 
  cryptography gets into production systems their official 
  recommendations at this point I believe um then you know we're 
  going to we're going to see a a desert of the ZK things that we 
  can use that will have strong Hardware support for and therefore 
  meet requirements for high Assurance systems so we think that 
  like eventually we need to go down the zero knowledge.
Wayne Chang:   Proof in circuits route.
Wayne Chang:  Said earlier you know there's already States 
  deploying these things right and that have to meet the 
  requirements today so are their approaches that we can also 
  consider to solve this problem and that's the topic of properly 
  forgotten signatures.
Wayne Chang:  So the idea is that can we just make sure that the 
  issuer forgets the signature and that is does not retain and have 
  evidence that they don't retain it this would be using a trusted 
  execution environment uh a lot of considerations when deploying a 
  trusted execution environment we'll get to those considerations 
  in a bit but um if the issuer doesn't know about the signature or 
  the other unique values then even if they're given you know a 
  stack of these things hey I clicked these digital signatures can 
  you help me match who it was the issue or should be able to say 
  you know no I can't because I just don't have that recorded right 
  so um we think that this could be a pragmatic approach to solving 
  the issue or verifier Collision problem today.
Wayne Chang:  Um this is how it would work uh this is an 
  imperfect diagram but hopefully a helpful visual um uh describer 
  with some rules um but the te The Trusted execution environment 
  is actually on the issuer side um sorry it's not totally clear 
  from this diagram but we have the issuer the holder and then also 
  The Trusted execution environment and it's pretty simple idea 
  that at the last step of issuing additional credential.
Wayne Chang:  Verifiable credential protected by the many forms 
  whether it's an envelope protection or um an embedded data proof 
  right so those could be all be supported could support the MDOC 
  from ISO anything where we have signing and this problem you know 
  we could find a tractable solution using this approach and again 
  these are production systems today so we have to look at what's 
  there.
Wayne Chang:  But the general approach uh is that as you do the 
  final stages of issuing the digital signature the unique values 
  that we don't want the issuer to be able to record or see right 
  um are basically computed exclusively in The Trusted execution 
  environment.
Wayne Chang:  For people not familiar with the te it's kind of 
  like a separate computer that is meant to hold things 
  confidential it's also called confidential Computing uh for that 
  reason uh things are encrypted as they are being processed inside 
  their um many teas will have their own set of public private keys 
  that you can encrypt things to and only the tea should be able to 
  decrypt it.
Wayne Chang:  All that stuff goes into the te and the computation 
  happens there.
Wayne Chang:  A nice property of teas is that it can give you an 
  attestation of computation the fact that hey this computation did 
  happen inside the te and uh you can verify it.
Wayne Chang:  So basically this is the general approach um and 
  then when you complete the signature and other artifacts you need 
  for issuance you would re encrypt that whole payload to the 
  user's key.
Wayne Chang:  So that it would only be encrypted inputs to the te 
  going in and then you would get encrypted outputs to the user's 
  device coming out and then the issuer would be none the wiser and 
  the holder would have uh a proof of computation happening in the 
  te so the trust model uh shifts from just the issuer to they 
  trust the issuer and they also trust them Hardware manufacturer 
  of the te um that it has not been tampered with and we'll go into 
  some considerations around where that assumption might not hold 
  but um that's the general idea again we're looking for something 
  that can uh help us uh with existing systems today without uh 
  necessarily changing any of the cryptography but could be Quant 
  post-quantum compatible going forward and uh requires a small 
  upgrade in 1 of the components to add on linkability as opposed 
  to again trying to rethink it wholesale which is difficult not 
  from the technology side necessarily.
Wayne Chang:   But from the policy.
Wayne Chang:  When people have a sunk cost in the multi-million 
  dollar project and you're asking them to be work entirely you 
  know that's another battle to fight.
Wayne Chang:   If you really.
Wayne Chang:  Care about this.
Wayne Chang:  So the benefits are that um you protect against 
  collusion because you're able to segregate those cryptographic 
  operations and we can prevent uh issue or verify or collusion 
  that way uh specifically we would still potentially issue many 
  signatures to protect against verify or verify our collusion.
Wayne Chang:  Privacy and security are added and we could 
  potentially do this within the context of being compliant to fips 
  140-2 or -3 which is which basically are the hardware um 
  standards for cryptographic modules by the federal information 
  processing standards.
Wayne Chang:  That are required for many issuers trying to work 
  on state Identity or other things.
Wayne Chang:  Our considerations of course every you know 
  engineering decision has trade-offs right so basically um.
Wayne Chang:  Have been known to fail that's the top 1 that we 
  really have to consider and think carefully about and and many of 
  the failure modes it's when the interfaces are connected to some 
  alien systems or it's when someone's side loads an application to 
  attack the te from like the mobile device many Android devices uh 
  the modern ones have trust Zone from the AMD processor and I 
  think a lot of the security assumptions for that te um were not 
  made to protect against attacks from the same device right like a 
  app loaded on the side or something so there are a lot of 
  weaknesses when you plug a tease into these arbitrary systems so 
  as an issuer you might have an option to not do that right and 
  you might have the option to have a defense and death strategy 
  around the te and it becomes more of a matter of having 
  third-party audits to make sure that the architecture is set up 
  correctly how it was designed and the controls have not been 
  tampered with so a lot of it would be adding in the Privacy 
  properties using tees.
Wayne Chang:   And also.
Wayne Chang:  Mechanisms in place too so it would have to be as 
  part of defense and death strategy teas alone are not enough.
Wayne Chang:  Um it's also a shift in trust model as I mentioned 
  uh instead of just trusting the issuer to get everything right 
  now for the critical part of it you can also uh add the trust for 
  a te manufacturer right and again this can be subject to 
  third-party audits.
Wayne Chang:  And uh 2 more considerations sometimes guidelines 
  from for implementers and laws requires certain retention periods 
  fraud investigations Etc right so there could be uh basically 
  privacy preserving ways to meet these guarantees or people can 
  decide to change the requirement for those if they value privacy 
  more right so um these can uh be implemented also using uh secure 
  Computing or confidential Computing to uh make sure that the 
  retention periods hold uh after let's say 30 days if that's the 
  requirement things can be erased right.
Wayne Chang:  Uh and then finally um 1 more consideration is um 
  now the issuer doesn't know the signatures that they made right 
  how bad could that be um 1 of the only downsides we've identified 
  so far you know subject to more research but is it's harder to 
  tell if your key was leaked and there are a bunch of erroneous or 
  fraudulent signatures being created by someone else right when 
  you had the signatures you could detect that if it was from your 
  issuer list but when you don't have the signature could be more 
  difficult um there are once again other methods to detect this 
  without requiring full knowledge of the signatures uh such as 
  cryptographic accumulators or even leveraging the te again for a 
  similar task of the retention period we just need to really know 
  the requirement for that and be able to engineer.
Wayne Chang:  Just that amount to basically find the balance 
  between you know accountability and auditability and also privacy 
  for then user.
Wayne Chang:  So this is not incompatible with zero knowledge 
  proof Solutions it's also not compatible with.
Wayne Chang:  Both can be you know implemented simultaneously 
  there are many approaches that want to use a zero knowledge proof 
  from the wallet to demonstrate to a verifier that indeed you know 
  I have a signature from the right issuing authority and here's 
  the attestation that would solve the problem too but in this sort 
  of evolving landscape you know I think that picking many 
  different defense and death strategies uh might be the best way 
  to achieve high security this methodology that I proposed only 
  requires the issuer to opt out right when you're looking at zero 
  knowledge proofs made from the wallet user proves uh that they 
  have an artifact from the issuer you need holder and verifier Buy 
  in to implement both of those parts and that's totally valid 
  solution right what I'm saying is that you can have this 
  production from the issuer side and you can have another 
  protection that requires holder and verifier opt-in so uh I think 
  that that's why we have to evaluate a plethora of solutions that 
  can interlock and be compatible with each other all adding 
  another layer.
Wayne Chang:   Of privacy guarantee.
Wayne Chang:  Um and this 1 Special is meant to upgrade existing 
  systems or work with an existing constraint environments uh under 
  regulation right and um leaving the door open to shift to zero 
  knowledge base systems as they become available off the shelf.
Wayne Chang:  And also um if we want this enshrined in the policy 
  to not create linkability right for digital identity systems it 
  is a bit incumbent on the industry to demonstrate its possible in 
  the first place right so this is a pragmatic way to achieve that 
  requirement uh much legislation gets thrown out because it's 
  considered not implementable.
Wayne Chang:  So I think eventually this could be standardized um 
  don't know where it would go but 1 of the goals was to be 
  compatible with a variety of data formats credential issuance and 
  presentation approaches including a lot of the great work here at 
  w3c but also other areas where they may evolve.
Wayne Chang:  And that's um the call to action is uh formalizing 
  this work into a more rigid set of requirements algorithms that 
  can have correctness or you know um flaws discovered right 
  because uh an idea is great but when you really get it into a set 
  of analyzable equations or just algorithms that can be evaluated 
  that's when we start to get to real security and getting towards 
  prototypes of this that can run in teas of today um also 
  evaluating the support for post-quantum cryptography this could 
  also result in policy language that could ask for this kind of 
  thing right so policy language could support policy that is like 
  legislative uh policy for democratically run governments um or 
  agency rulemaking creating the requirement for a linkability and 
  how we can satisfy those with something like this or is there a 
  knowledge proofs.
Wayne Chang:  Formalize this more.
Wayne Chang:  Uh potentially you know incorporated into some 
  implementations.
Wayne Chang:   Um and.
Wayne Chang:  Thank you for your time and listening to this I can 
  open it up to any questions or feedback connect on LinkedIn or 
  send me an email.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Wayne uh dimitry you're in the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Explain that as always this is really cool and 
  informative I have.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   A quick question about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You don't mind going back to the verification 
  part um uh how does the so in the issuing The Trusted execution 
  environment uh is involved on the issuer side and how does the 
  verification work again.
Wayne Chang:  It works just as before so you just present you do 
  all the regular steps and um the only difference is if the 
  verifier was to retain the signature and present it back to the 
  issuer saying who's this this year would say I have no idea who 
  you're talking about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Got it got it.
Manu Sporny:  Um yeah a great presentation Wayne thank you um I 
  think you know utilizing these trusted execution environments is 
  um as you said like a really good layered approach that um.
Manu Sporny:  Is a is another layer to the security onion um I'm 
  wondering you know so you're saying there's a the shift in trust 
  that happens and I I think I understand what you're saying you're 
  like the the issuer needs to trust that these tees are doing what 
  it expects them to do are you expecting there to be like I don't 
  know formally audited um te run times um that are used so so for 
  for the for those that might not be aware you know a lot of these 
  teas have ways of like digitally signing and verifying the 
  executables that run in the teas so that when the issue or runs 1 
  of these things they can be assured that they know what programs 
  running in there and they trust its execution to do you know 
  something uh uh specific um and that trust can also go to like 
  the holder or other verifiers where anyone can check to make sure 
  that the issuer is using like a known te that does.
Manu Sporny:   Known things.
Manu Sporny:  In a certain order.
Manu Sporny:  So Wayne are you the the the 1 thing so 2 questions 
  the first 1 is are you expecting there to be like a a vetting 
  process and digital signatures to these programs that run in the 
  te so that everyone can kind of know that the right programs 
  running um and then the second thing is you said that there is 
  communication uh between the holder and the um te but the issuer 
  also has to provide some data like for example in a driver's 
  license the issue is definitely going to I think going to uh 
  provide all the driver's license uh data in there um can you 
  elaborate more on like like I I get it where like a holder key is 
  sent to the te but were you thinking other things like you're 
  you're saying like the issuer doesn't have any idea about this 
  thing that's being issued um.
Manu Sporny:   Does that mean.
Manu Sporny:  Any of the information that it hands over or does 
  it mean like no just the like the private key that the the uh the 
  holder might use for doing like holder binding um that's it.
Wayne Chang:  Yeah great questions uh so to your first question 
  um attestations for computation right so how do we know that the 
  te is running the right code um we think that this is the part 
  that could be made open source um where you have the code running 
  in the te that people can evaluate and uh basically many teas 
  this would have to be a requirement When selecting a te can 
  produce these attestations um sign off by the you know Hardware 
  down key inside the te the fact that this particular program ran 
  um with you know this kind of inputs and produce this right and 
  that happens all within the the secure protected part of the um 
  of the Machinery uh producing like a certification that it 
  happened there.
Wayne Chang:   And the.
Wayne Chang:  Ability for people to evaluate that open source 
  code repository or maybe it's an audited by a third party or 
  something like that a lot of the times they'll even accept like a 
  Docker container or something I think some of the t's support 
  that right so it would be a certain image identifier um that was 
  running here and we got these inputs reduced the output the 
  wallet would be able to evaluate uh that attestation to know that 
  it came from the te um manufacturer uh for example AMD and how it 
  changes the trust model is that instead of just trusting the 
  issuer uh you can trust you would in order for someone to include 
  it against you you would either need like AMD for example or 
  whatever manufacturer to collude with the issuer to uh basically 
  create a flawed system right and then um.
Wayne Chang:  Would have to.
Wayne Chang:  Protections of the te so it just again adds more um 
  guarantees and securities and the onion model as Manu mentioned 
  so that's the first question man does that answer your first 
  question I can move on to the next 1.
Wayne Chang:  Great so the second 1 um the issuer already knows a 
  whole bunch of stuff about you right so your full name your 
  driver's license all these things are already personally 
  identifiable information and if you're sharing those things then 
  this approach can't help you right so then we need to rely on 
  data policy like gdpr or CCPA in California and other similar 
  ones that are emerging around the world to really limit the 
  sharing information I think that's definitely a huge problem to 
  do consent management at scale and a machine readable manner I 
  think that's a very exciting problem space to solve and get right 
  um but this approach doesn't help with that um here we are 
  optimized for if you're proving that you're over 18 I mean there 
  are ton of people over 18 how do we make sure that doesn't create 
  a correlated event.
Wayne Chang:  So that's more of the problem if we're sharing pii 
  in the semantic layer as part of the interaction then yeah this 
  approach is limited in that.
Harrison_Tang: By the way uh Wayne just to clarify so uh further 
  clarify when you said shift in the trust model to the hardware 
  manufacturer you mean the trust in the signature right you're not 
  talking about the trust in the content in the in the data itself 
  is that is that correct.
Wayne Chang:  Yeah yeah it's kind of like how many people need to 
  plot against you right to get 1 over you and in many models you 
  have to have a lot of trust in the issuer if you want to prevent 
  this issue or verify or collusion but in this model we've shifted 
  to well not only does the issuer need to be nefarious but also 
  the hardware manufacturer either needs to be nefarious or 
  destroyed by the protections or destroyed by the issuer.
Harrison_Tang: To further clarify because I'm not super familiar 
  with how te works but in this uh proposal basically the issue or 
  does not know the public key of the device itself the only the T 
  its public key private key uh uh of the device it's all protected 
  within the te so all all the issuer knows is the the signature 
  that that gets computed from the from the key is that is that 
  correct or.
Wayne Chang:  Um so the um the issuer doesn't even know the 
  signature coming out um so and you're correct that the all the 
  user unique values from their device including um maybe a device 
  key would be encrypted uh to the te uh many teas have 
  functionality where there's a key that only they can access right 
  it's because it's protected in the same Enclave for environment.
Wayne Chang:  Would encrypt to that key so that the te would be 
  the only 1 who can unpack that value operating in the secure 
  context.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Wayne Chang:  Yep and what the um all the issuer would see is um 
  well they they would probably do some brokering of a connectivity 
  to the device but they would just see an encrypted payload in an 
  encrypted payload out I would say an analogy is kind of like 
  trying to monitor a network uh over TCP when they're like TLS 
  connections happening you see that there was a connection some 
  data payload sent and that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions man please.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I mean this is a this is all like super 
  fascinating uh topic uh Wayne so so you're you're saying you know 
  for the use cases where we really want on linkability um like you 
  know over 18 uh is a member of this Bank um is a member of this 
  club things like that that the the individual and wallet you know 
  would would go to an issuer and start some kind of issuance 
  process and it's some point the issuer goes like hey I've got a 
  pretty you know I've got strong I know who this individual is 
  like I've I've set up a secure Channel with them and like they 
  are who I think they are um but for this next step I want you the 
  te to generate a membership credential for them or generate an 
  over 18 credeur and I'm going to be completely out of the.
Manu Sporny:   Loop there right.
Manu Sporny:  I want you to.
Manu Sporny:  Generate a note.
Manu Sporny:  Credential for them I'm going to hook you up to 
  them and they're going to provide you a known set of inputs that 
  I as the issuer am okay with them sending you um and then you do 
  your thing te get them the credential and I the issue are none 
  none the wiser so if that credential ever comes back to me I'm 
  gonna basically be like yeah I issued that but I have no idea 
  which 1 of my members it goes to all I do know is that I did a 
  process before issuing it that guaranteed that it went to a 
  legitimate party is is that a fair summary of what you're 
  suggesting.
Wayne Chang:  Yep that's fair so you're asking the te to finish 
  issuing this credential and the te says to you issuer you know I 
  need these things from you okay I'm gonna expect these other 
  things from the user but you're not going to hear about it and I 
  think 1 of the nice considerations of this model is that um you 
  know in some future iteration the te host doesn't even need to be 
  the same entity as the issuer right so if there's a common entity 
  that you both trust or something that's running a strong root 
  program to for public key infrastructure then you might designate 
  them as uh you know managing the cryptographic attestation of 
  issuer data.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry a quick clarification question Wayne so so 
  the verifier has to have the public key of the issuers to really 
  uh to to verify the signature right so uh if the issuer doesn't 
  even know uh these uh Keys then how how does the verify uh can 
  how can the verify ensure that it's actually verifying uh the 
  credentials from the from the issuers from from the intended 
  issuer.
Wayne Chang:  Yep great question um so the the issuer would still 
  disclose its public key or its root key um the public part of it 
  of course um and that would be included in you know a trust 
  framework so that if a signature is created by this uh the 
  private part of that key then we know it's from the issuer right 
  so um that part is still shared with the verifiers and you could 
  use something like did web or otherwise to establish that but the 
  point is that the actual signatures as part of the credentials 
  are not retained so the issuer is none the wiser.
Wayne Chang:  The issuer could see a signature and it could 
  verify that oh it looks like my private he did create this right 
  but it wouldn't have prior knowledge of that signature is the 
  idea.
Harrison_Tang: Got it cool.
Harrison_Tang: Money go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  Um what standards do you feel like this group or 
  what what standards do you feel like need to be put in place 
  Swain for this thing to like um for us to make progress on this.
Wayne Chang:  Yeah so I was doing the research in the different 
  ecosystems like what's the closest thing to this and I think the 
  closest thing to this is actually the Acme protocol which is used 
  by let's encrypt a provision x509 certificates for the let's 
  encrypt program but it it might generally just be a way where you 
  check things and issue stuff in terms of like this this would be 
  a general protocol that hopefully can support a bunch of 
  different formats um I think that formalizing some of the 
  expectations like what do we need the te to support for this 
  model to work right and then uh where are the different criteria 
  could be really helpful homework to that point that helps.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions for.
PL: Yes uh thanks very much I this.
PL: Breaks me that if the apples and the Amazon and the Googles 
  in the world are going to be also providing the teas for these 
  these applications um.
PL: It seems like it's almost imperative that a third party.
PL: Uh accounting or inspection of the way in which uh data is 
  being.
PL: Part of the.
PL: That we've always had questions about trusting is that a fair 
  fair assertion.
Wayne Chang:  Yeah definitely so I think that um encouraging 
  multiple entities and fortunately there there are uh I'd say not 
  plethora but there are much more optionality when you're looking 
  at te vendors so making sure that there's some separation of 
  concerns there and the right degree of auditability would be 
  pretty important to making sure this runs correctly right.
Wayne Chang:  There are also some open Hardware teas that are 
  making their way to production which I'm excited about but also 
  you know fortunately there's a bunch of production ready stuff 
  today too.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I think 1 of the coolest I uh coolest thing 
  about this idea is that I don't think the hardware manufacturers 
  has too much skin in this game right so so they don't really have 
  as much of an economic incentives to KU in my opinion.
Wayne Chang:  Yeah I think there's a certain strategy credit for 
  Hardware manufacturers to play this right because they protect so 
  many payloads with their te stuff right everything from the data 
  pipelines used for AI and everything else so if they were to 
  collude and you know backdoor a te then I think the brand would 
  have some very negative impact uh right and that that would be 
  painful so I think that like the game theory around it is like 
  pretty interesting that we're able to shift to a different model.
Harrison_Tang: Yep um any other questions.
Harrison_Tang: All right well thank you thanks Dwayne thanks for 
  taking the time uh it's always cool to have you here and present 
  these cool ideas thanks a lot.
Wayne Chang:  Great thank you so much for the time here um yeah I 
  definitely uh appreciate this and I will note again teas are not 
  perfect you'll look at sgx fail to see some failure modes of late 
  so have to be part of a layered approach but you know it's a step 
  in the right direction I think so appreciate everyone's time.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks a lot uh so this concludes this 
  week's ccg meeting um well we'll see we'll skip next Tuesday's CG 
  meeting and resume on October 1st thanks a lot bye.

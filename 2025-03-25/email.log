Harrison_Tang: Yeah and then uh Lucy all right so yeah we will I 
  think we have the hackathon like a couple months ago right so 
  they're very excited to have them here to talk about and share 
  some learnings and lessons.
Lucy Yang:  Hi uh thank you very much her uh can everyone hear me 
  fine just want to double check again.
Lucy Yang:  Okay great because I I know that last time I I was on 
  camera I broke the you know entire thing so I won't be showing up 
  my face on camera this time um but thank you very much um 
  Harrison also the ccg for having me again to talk about the 
  hackathon you know Cleo was being humbled it's not about her but 
  I I'm glad that you know and she is here and also I know Manny 
  was here because Kalia and get involved as um as a judge for the 
  first hackathon and and all as an expert it's like expert oh 
  actually as an audience for the second 1 so she definitely have a 
  um you know you know something she can share about her experience 
  and a Manu and his team was um uh a critical part of of making 
  the hackathon happen and especially the hackathon is called the 
  the um the cmdl community hackathon is a community thing so 
  anyone you know on this call who hasn't been part of it or.
Lucy Yang:   You know.
Lucy Yang:  Are most welcome to share I'll probably like a Manu 
  and Clea also kind of calling you a little bit later just share 
  what you know your kind of your takeaway of the hackathon if if 
  you don't mind.
Lucy Yang:  Um I have I have a few slides um prepared so I'm uh.
Lucy Yang:  Everyone see my screen.
Lucy Yang:  Okay okay great just want to be you know disclaimer 
  so I'm I'm sharing um kind of I'm I'm I'm speaking on today's 
  call not as not representing the the California DMV and 
  representing myself and Company and it's it's probably many of 
  you know like Leah and we have been working together as you know 
  in a Business Partnership to run our consulting firm specializing 
  this decentralized dent in the particularly I mean in the past 
  year or so we have been kind of getting our our what were you 
  know where should be our focus more critical crystallized um in 
  terms of like ecosystem and Alignment building particularly the 
  amount of complex Endeavors and stakeholder groups so this is 
  kind of like how we're where I'm coming from today when when 
  we're sharing uh kind of a an example of the kind of work we've 
  been doing with our clients.
Lucy Yang:  As you can see like we've been working with quite 
  some like a large um large and entities like the California 
  Department of your calls like you know International Air 
  transport Association and many others um it's really um.
Lucy Yang:  I was like hackathon where many of the other work 
  we're doing are really kind of a revolving around how um we're 
  helping the the most critical players in the industry to build to 
  to better and build ecosystem and alignment.
Lucy Yang:  This is kind of where where I'm coming from today um.
Lucy Yang:  And and also um I think and Harrison you mentioned 
  that you know mentioned Gail and it's probably many of you know 
  like Gail hodgers who is the executive director um of an open ID 
  Foundation uh and also another hash is wearing is the special is 
  a is advisor senior advisor to the um to the California 
  Department of Motor Vehicles on identity technology which also 
  I'm an advisor so this is kind of like the many of us wear 
  multiple hats but I do want to knowledge that the open ID 
  Foundation you know as a community partner.
Lucy Yang:  In the hackathon.
Lucy Yang:  Where's the DMV played a critical role in Gail 
  herself wearing both hats was very very instrumental and to make 
  the hackathon um uh a success I think she's able to make it today 
  but definitely want to own a knowledge her her work and her.
Lucy Yang:  Her contribution to to to the hackathons um so when 
  actually the idea of the hackathon initially a Gail came up with 
  the idea of a hackathon before and I even get started working 
  working on you know designing it with her um so when we uh when 
  kind of when the idea of a hackathon were like the um kind of got 
  out to kind of sum of the initial stakeholders were like when 
  we're reaching out um you know as part of working for California 
  DMV like all the idea of a hackathon and you can the kind of the 
  first reaction a lot of people give us oh it's uh it's a kind of 
  a competition kind of thing it's as many of you probably know um 
  like hackathons so normally run when there's you know particular 
  problem um where like there's some kind of solutions like a 
  government or entity seeking and hosting kind of a competition 
  and you know encouraging developers and and we're we're not 
  developers team to participate to solve a a particular problem um 
  for for you know for for clear and I we when we run a company 
  like in from our point of view and also for the point.
Lucy Yang:   Of view you have um us help.
Lucy Yang:  Helping the California DMV.
Lucy Yang:  We really look at hackathon as a tool.
Lucy Yang:  Way to engage with stakeholders um to address a 
  technical oriented problem together um I could you know.
Lucy Yang:  You can obviously run as a competition but but the 
  most important thing like we want to highlight here is really how 
  we engage with the right stakeholders to really kind of so we can 
  work together on address the problem.
Lucy Yang:  That's some that's the part I want to highlight um.
Lucy Yang:  So here sorry here so I I'm I'm going to switch over 
  to a public slides that um the the DMV um use for at at in 
  January at the um the public briefing um for the hackathon also 
  in the meantime let me share.
Lucy Yang: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j9VShUxcnb3XQGRAU1-3BCS8t7L0wmV601vRy_HAgjM/edit?usp=sharing
Lucy Yang:  So I'm so I'm I I copy paste my at this link to my 
  slide so you will have all like the resources so in my slides 
  you'll have all the resources that linking to different kind of a 
  resources related to the hackathon.
Lucy Yang:   But he.
Lucy Yang:  Here I'm going now I'm going to switch over um to 
  kind of hackathon related slides that the California DMV has made 
  public so we so I can speak more to kind of the um.
Lucy Yang:  What you know how some of the the outcomes that 
  hackathon have and also like a takeaway and the takeaway is that 
  we as a company have uh just double-checking are we we're not 
  looking at the right slice let me making sure.
Lucy Yang:  Let's see if you're in the right slides.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Lucy Yang:  Is the private sector uh event use cases so if you 
  you know.
Lucy Yang:   So if you.
Lucy Yang:  You go in this slide after after my presentation you 
  can definitely dive into to the different use cases but as you 
  can see there are um because essentially the category like you 
  know our our our quite simple is identity proofing kyc on a 
  boarding is kind of 1 1 category and identity and age 
  verification is another category and then there's a password 
  authentication from kind of like a high level kind of 
  categorization point of view they're not not not kind of like too 
  many categories but if you're looking at the the different types 
  of of organizations or large large and very large Enterprises and 
  they are like also like smaller.
Lucy Yang:  Small smaller players and also there are some there 
  are a large Financial agencies like there are not not able to 
  disclose their names but it's and if you look at the use cases 
  are really covering different range of use cases so many of the 
  um of the um the the participants they're working on a wider 
  range of use cases but because we asked them to be very very 
  specific and about the real world needs and for the vendors to 
  really engage with their with their clients so that's why like 
  the you know we have there are some kind of like each use case as 
  specific sector but doesn't mean that those kind of participating 
  work Nation are limited to that sector um only.
Lucy Yang: 
  https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/california-dmv-mdl-hackathon-briefing-and-roadmap/
Lucy Yang:  And the public sector event we also have a kind of a 
  similar chart that we have you know the different categories and 
  and a different agencies that participated so I won't dive too 
  much into it if you know any of you you already have the the link 
  to I I can let me share this the link of this slides again and in 
  the chat so this is a public um.
Lucy Yang:  And what 1 1 thing I think you will be interested in 
  uh getting if you want to get an idea so like so the hackathon 
  highlights so if you go to like the YouTube video there's a kind 
  of 10-minute video really show kind of like how it feels you know 
  like to be part of the hackathon so we had like the kind of 
  Snippets of different in the 2 events to give you an idea like 
  how the engagement goes and also some of the feedback from the 
  from the teams and and and observers and and experts on the day.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Lucy Yang:  Because we are we you know I I think this is like a 
  challenge you know most of us were facing today is like we are 
  you know we are seeing like the the decentralized identity where 
  the standards are kind of taking off but the same time they're 
  not they're not not enough like resources to support like our 
  work right we also like we're in an environment where resource or 
  constraints and and and also like how in the in in that kind of 
  environment how we provide incentives right to um to like 
  stakeholders to be able to.
Lucy Yang:  To really kind of come together and work on something 
  and and probably and and what what I probably already talked 
  about like in my previous um kind of presentation at ccg so this 
  the 2 hacks there's no kind of.
Lucy Yang:   There's no.
Lucy Yang:  Prize money any any any organizations or any 
  organizations participate need to really invest themselves like 
  whether in the time of their people to really work on like you 
  know to prepare for the 4 weeks and and also for them to the 
  people to really travel because we asked each team to have like 
  at least 2 people to to uh to join in person on on the on the 
  event day to really kind of like travel and and accommodation 
  really come to the event in person right so so this and 
  especially when you know there's no kind of money incentive how 
  to really align people like the you know the interest like the of 
  different parties to be able to pull something together so that 
  that's something like really this event really helped you know a 
  a good way of of for us to learn how to really be be very clear 
  with like what objectives and also what is in there for different 
  stakeholders and and also when we're reaching out to relying 
  parties really kind of have an understanding of the different 
  level like of um where they're at and not.
Lucy Yang:  Now trying to kind of get.
Lucy Yang:  People who are not there yet but also providing kind 
  of like strong narratives why it matters to to them and let them 
  make an informed decision so that's you know that was really 
  really helpful and and another kind of takeaway you know 
  especially for me as a business person really coordinating the 
  entire process to learn about where where like the tech and 
  standard you know the Readiness is because because a lot of 
  sometimes for me like it it doesn't sound difficult but really 
  when I'm looking at how like manners team and a few other you 
  know like Google like pitched in to help with some of the teams 
  and with issues with open Wallet Called Quest some of you know 
  also Spruce and was very involved in kind of all like how how how 
  people on board with the wallet and style really when working 
  with these teams like on a technical side to really try to solve 
  them these issues like roadblocks for the for the hackathon teams 
  really helped me um as a business person who was not too deep 
  deeply involved in the standards or Tech development to 
  understand where things are today and some of the kind of the 
  main things that kind of stand in the way of of adoption.
Lucy Yang:   And last.
Lucy Yang:  Mention a lot of really about the community and 
  collaboration so this is actually the third time I'm doing this 
  kind of a similar presentation um I post the hackathon like the 
  first 1 it did it was at oh WF a few weeks ago and I did in 
  person when when I was at when I was in Zurich for for dice um 
  like 2 3 weeks ago and I'm doing it again and I do I truly 
  believe that this kind of like community in collaboration really 
  sharing what what you know I've learned what our company has 
  learned and continue collaborating with you know broadly with 
  different communities and to really kind of because because at 
  the end of the day like you know like California DMV right and 
  also Plus open ID foundation work kind of a the main organized 
  we're co-hosting it but without like support of the community 
  like who have spreading the word we really kind of providing 
  tooling and providing support a lot of them involuntary manner if 
  this this 1 have happened and I think another kind of um.
Lucy Yang:  Clear when so clear um uh went to the identity and 
  payment Summit and I hosted by and secure technology Alliance 
  like a month ago in in San Diego so they had an mdl showcase 
  which actually and they organized like you know um and they 
  organized in a way that kind of they learned from so we spoke 
  quite a few times with the the some of the core organizers of the 
  mdl Showcase we share our experience hosting we're you know 
  hoping host a hackathon and they kind of learned from that 
  experience and designed it for for for a different event and so 
  this is also kind of the community part how how how you know the 
  the California kind of uh Community hackathon could really kind 
  of helped either other kind of organizations who are thinking 
  about something similar the experiences they are really can learn 
  you know.
Lucy Yang:   To share.
Lucy Yang:  So these kind of like engagement will keep happening 
  across different parts of the community so that's kind of like 
  um.
Lucy Yang:  Some of the key kind of learnings and takeaways and 
  with that I would love to see if if Kia and Manu you know if you 
  want to share it because you're you're you're also part part of 
  that in you know in different ways anything you would like to 
  share about that the hackathon.
Manu Sporny:  Absolutely go ahead Kalia though.
Kaliya Young:  Go ahead man.
Manu Sporny:  Okay um uh yeah it was great I mean I think you 
  know first of all like I cannot underscore how much Lucy was a 
  force of nature that pulled all all the things from all the 
  different you know organizations together I mean it it would not 
  have.
Manu Sporny:  Um uh it wouldn't have happened uh without Lucy she 
  was very much at the at the center of making sure everyone had 
  what they needed and organizing and and all that stuff so a huge 
  huge thank you to to Lucy and and Kalia to um you know for for 
  supporting that I feel like each plus 1 you know the it was 
  really nice to see the community get together and it does take a 
  lot of effort.
Manu Sporny:  You know to get that that kind of group together 
  and um get them interrupting um we could probably speak to it 
  more from kind of a support uh perspective um uh it was it was 
  very clear I think through the whole hackathon that um you know 
  many of the people that were new to uh verifiable credentials and 
  uh mdl and MDOC um really needed like tooling for their it teams 
  to use some of them kind of came came to the table and um you 
  know if there wasn't kind of ready tooling for them to kind of 
  integrate with that would uh move them forward they they tended 
  to not not do super well right I mean we we had a couple of early 
  contacts with groups that um uh you know either weren't Fielding 
  their own software or didn't have an IT team to to put the new 
  software in place and that resulted in them kind of having to you 
  know back away a.
Manu Sporny:  But um 1 of the other you know upsides is that you 
  know having tooling there really accelerated that you know the 
  organization's ability to figure out um you know whether or not 
  this thing's going to going to work for them um.
Manu Sporny:  1 Of the other things that's Lucy you know 
  mentioned that was really nice to see is like the very broad like 
  diversity among the different use cases like they weren't all 
  like age verification and they weren't all like um uh you know 
  handing over your your driver's license at a at a traffic stop um 
  there were a number of financial industry use cases for like ekyc 
  um there were a number of really interesting um uh kind of um 
  migrant worker uh use cases um uh and things of that nature um.
Manu Sporny:  Lucy also mentioned that in that slide deck uh they 
  also um you know talked to how they're using um things like um uh 
  uh these new digital Technologies for things like vehicle 
  registration and disability placards and uh emergency credentials 
  for individuals um that have been you know a part of uh like a 
  disaster to like rapidly re onboard them uh in their idea.
Manu Sporny:  Um so it was it was the the number of use cases um 
  was pretty uh nice to see like it was a broad swath of things I 
  think 1 of the things that our community tends to get a bit 
  concerned about is like is this just about you know driver's 
  licenses and only driver's licenses or you know is this just 
  about age verification and only H verification but I think the 
  hackathon kind of showed you know all the different industries 
  that are looking at uh using you know digital credentials to kind 
  of enhance um you know the way they they interact with people 
  either by you know making things more fraud resistant uh or um 
  you know making certain business processes move faster or you 
  know being able to do these things online whereas before you had 
  to like physically drive to a location to to do a particular 
  business process so it was good it was it was a really really 
  great event and again huge plus 1 to.
Manu Sporny:  Uh you know helped help everyone you know be 
  successful there um especially uh Lucy that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Lucy like what do you think is the most surprising 
  on anticipate a use case that you you uh learn from the the sack.
Lucy Yang:  This is a question for me.
Lucy Yang:  I don't know what is.
Lucy Yang:  All surprising I I wouldn't say anything is is is 
  surprising but I I I think that so there is a few use cases where 
  like I'm the out is just a starting point.
Lucy Yang:  So there's really kind of how what.
Lucy Yang:  1 Thing so if.
Lucy Yang:  So if you look at the the Kaiser Permanente uh um 
  that use case it was about how you know there in healthcare and 
  insurance right it's like is so they work in a use case about 
  enroll enrollment in employer benefits systems and and government 
  fund funded programs and then house plans right is there have 
  like multiple kind of level of kind of use of mobile drivers as a 
  mobile drivers as this is just a part of it right because it's 
  really kind of going back to maannews point not just about like 
  you know getting you know used very you know use mobile drivers 
  lessons for for like age age verification like a simple use case 
  where probably what what will claim to our mind when we're 
  thinking about mobile drivers and they're kind of a lot of like 
  deeper use cases that mobile driver sizes will play a critical 
  role I think those ones are are particularly in an eye-opening 
  for me I wouldn't be say surprising it's just not something that 
  all like as natural as intuitive as the ah verification what.
Lucy Yang:   Hope hope that makes.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thanks dimitry.
Harrison_Tang: Demetri I think you're on the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh thanks uh thanks everyone and thank you 
  Lucy uh really great presentation my question is about the Apple 
  wallet and Google Wallet supports.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so so 1 of the earlier slides mentioned 
  that they added support for mobile driver's licenses I'm assuming 
  the iso standard not VC 1.1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and my my question is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What level of support is it does it do any 
  kind of signature does it do any kind of selective disclosure is 
  it just I'm able to show the card and pull it up uh just just 
  curious what uh big Tech is thinking at this very moment.
Lucy Yang:  I may not be able to give you the answer that you 
  need but what I can say is that at the time of the hackathon 
  which was like last fall right like the Apple and Google Wallet 
  was not part of the scope for the hackathon so it's so they're 
  they're critical in the sense that you know the launch we knew 
  that because of that launch and more more Californians will get 
  um a mobile driver's license and want to use it make you know 1 
  or more of a ball drivers more useful but but this.
Lucy Yang:  Are closed and the launch was pretty close to the 
  hackathon so both wallet were not part of the um the scope for 
  the hackathon and depending you know on your right in terms of at 
  least in my knowledge um is only the iso um standard that were 
  supported in both wallet I actually don't know why things are 
  today and also what to what extent I can share I can share on the 
  other technical aspect.
Harrison_Tang: By the way dimitry I I have the California driver 
  license on my iPhone Apple wallet and I have downloaded the 
  California DMV uh wallet I think for the Apple wallet it's just 
  showing the card that's it I don't think it has a selected 
  disclosures or anything like that.
Harrison_Tang: Uh I also yeah I also know that uh uh the digital 
  credentials API their work will include selected disclosure but 
  in regards to the current implementation for the wallets I don't 
  think it has selected disclosure.
Harrison_Tang: All right Richard.
Richard: All right what's the next step for the California mdl 
  especially for remote presentation I know in January they're 
  talking about having a public uh a public test portal for in late 
  February so I'm interested with the status of that is.
Lucy Yang:  Richard I know like you you signed up for this we're 
  still working on it so it's not it's not it it's just yeah it's 
  it's getting it's getting close um so so like if you.
Lucy Yang:  The public and slides I shared um on the DMV slice of 
  ritual speaking to um 1 of the next staff that we announced um in 
  the on the January public briefing is really trying to because we 
  the the the hackathon allowed like the um companies and 
  implementers relying parties to more easily kind of engage with 
  the California DMV and leverage of the tooling and support so 
  that's also part of the goals that we want make it easier for for 
  smaller bigger companies to to be able to kind of test mobile 
  drivers when a mobile driver's license and and and in January we 
  did set that we're we're working on kind of a process to allow 
  more entities beyond the hackathon teams to be able to do it so 
  what I can say we're still we're still on it and it's definitely 
  have we have made some progress I don't have like kind of a a a 
  date for you yet but it's definitely getting getting closer so 
  hopefully you know like.
Lucy Yang:  You will be able to access that soon um and and and 
  and what I can say is it won't be for everyone because we do have 
  limited resources like would you like a California have limited 
  resources is not like decision I I you know I'm able to make um 
  but definitely we're like like I mentioned in my earlier 
  presentation like the support to on a reliant parties implemented 
  entire so it's still ongoing because I'm still kind of engaging 
  with quite some hackathon teams and and to to really help them um 
  so that's kind of so on the way did I did I.
Richard: Thank you that's helpful when should we follow up next 
  do you think it's a month away or multiple months.
Lucy Yang:  I hopefully it shouldn't be multiple months um I 
  hopefully we can have because I we we did have a kind of a 
  express your interest form right and whoever like you who have 
  signed up for for this hopefully we can get at least give you an 
  update very very soon.
Lucy Yang:  I'm I'm actively working on it today so definitely 
  it's not like shouldn't be too far away.
Manu Sporny:  No I wanted to come back to Kalia to get her 
  thoughts on the hackathon.
Kaliya Young:  Um sure uh I got to be a judge in the first 1 I 
  think um.
Kaliya Young:  The range of of different entities involved was um 
  good to see so we had everything from an undisclosed financial 
  institution to folks um.
Kaliya Young:  Building apps for uh bouncers to use at the door 
  to scan um.
Kaliya Young:  Scan ID cards um of when folks are entering bars 
  um.
Kaliya Young:  I'm being a judge is hard.
Kaliya Young:  That all sounds great right how do you evaluate 
  all these things.
Kaliya Young:  Yeah and I think the the 1 for the public sector 
  it was great to see there was actually folks from other countries 
  who are participating as well.
Kaliya Young:  Um so the definition of public sector was like 
  California and Beyond and that was really nice to see.
Kaliya Young:  Yeah so those are those are some thoughts.
Harrison_Tang: May I ask like who do you pick uh who did you pick 
  as a winner and why.
Kaliya Young:  Oh um we actually I think it's somewhere on the 
  slides probably um we didn't actually have we sort of had like 
  categories that we selected people we thought did well in we 
  didn't really have like an ultimate winner.
Kaliya Young:  So yeah I can't I was it was in the fall I was in 
  the beginning of October so I'm not totally sure but I think it's 
  in the in the documents we have.
Lucy Yang:  Now what I.
Harrison_Tang: What about like sorry.
Lucy Yang:  So how is it just on that point I want to add is um 
  like some so for the first event um we're even just in general 
  for the both event we provided some kind of um.
Lucy Yang:  Kind of not just the criteria some of the um like the 
  main things that um like experts and judges were even audience 
  will want to see right like the the private you know security and 
  privacy preserving and you know a viability of the use cases and 
  there like you know user experience so these are some like 
  metrics that we you know kind of we provided to the team so they 
  can they can they can be cognizant that when they're developing 
  their use case in the presentations so clear was speaking to like 
  the first event and you know we we did have some kind of like 
  best user experience you know best privacy you know I mean design 
  and a best privacy and security design you know more social 
  impactful use cases where most compelling use cases so like the 
  video like I was referring to earlier like the 10-minute video at 
  the end of that there is kind of a complete list of like what 
  what you know which which team and and which team got got what 
  kind of recognition and for the second for the public sector 
  event like we didn't do kind of a judging only expert panel so we 
  had kind of.
Lucy Yang:  And I you know for for some of the some of the 
  categories because at the end of the day it's not about 
  competition it's really recognizing what we know recognizing that 
  you know where where given where we're at today right like you 
  know some of the the the good things like the back the good 
  practices like the teams are you know the the teams are are.
Lucy Yang:   Are are.

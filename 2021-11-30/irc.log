[2021-11-30T17:37:16.469Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: although there are many private and state-level stakeholders, decision process has largely focused on NATIONAL scale

[2021-11-30T17:38:11.274Z]	<juancaballero>	... issuer-centric (i.e. state drivers' bureaus); issuance definition deferred
[2021-11-30T17:38:46.004Z]	<juancaballero>	... identification document was a secondary consideration, which happened in a later stage of the design after core drivers' licensing use-cases were fleshed out
[2021-11-30T17:40:08.925Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: Contextualizing the adoption path and likely future of the spec: too issuer-centric to get widespread private sector uptake; not web-native enough to get widespread web uptake; co-existence with more web-native standards like VC seems a realistic hope to hold, imho
[2021-11-30T17:41:34.160Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: Random addenda: android working on "identity credential API"; apple actively working on native mDL/mDocs support in Apple Wallet; AAMVA and international corollaries are making swift progress specifying trust frameworks (modelled on ICAO master CA list) for production-ready issuance infra a few years down the road

[2021-11-30T17:50:30.619Z]	<juancaballero>	... perhaps this is leverage for us to intervene in day 2?
[2021-11-30T17:50:53.003Z]	<mprorock>	that is honestly totally unrealistic - ISO is where this will stay, and from a US standpoint NIST is the path
[2021-11-30T17:51:18.724Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: TBH it's quite unlikely that the ISO group would take substantial feedback from CCG, or W3C, or anywhere else; front door is ISO via ANSI or your national body

[2021-11-30T17:53:26.006Z]	<juancaballero>	... there are people in the decentralized id/VC world at the table already, i'm hardly the only one
[2021-11-30T17:54:02.716Z]	<juancaballero>	... I personally look forward to seeing the work put together by DB, Mattr and Spruce, and I think implementable, tested code is the strongest inticement to invite guests
[2021-11-30T17:54:48.145Z]	<juancaballero>	... The conversation is ongoing with many stakeholders, and all of the member orgs are contributing to expanding the scope and bringing in input from the market and the communities we know
[2021-11-30T17:54:50.454Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	ack Manu_S
[2021-11-30T17:55:24.991Z]	<juancaballero>	Manu: thank you so much for taking the initiative and donating your time here. you mentioned the "MSO" object and how it fits-- i have no easy answer
[2021-11-30T17:55:42.938Z]	<juancaballero>	... there are ways to make it work, but it would require cooperation/dialogue with the mDocs implementers
[2021-11-30T17:55:58.085Z]	<juancaballero>	... which can be quite hard to have from outside the ISO WG and its IPR perimeter
[2021-11-30T17:56:41.860Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: Anyone who wants to talk about implementation details, feel free to reach out, those implementers aren't completely closed off to dialogue, although it might need to be indirect and definitely wouldn't happen at WG meetings proper
[2021-11-30T17:56:54.460Z]	<juancaballero>	Manu: What is the best way for us to engage? What we've been doing doesn't seem to be working
[2021-11-30T17:57:22.633Z]	<juancaballero>	... the WG was listed as an official liaison in the VCWG chartering process, and there was essentially no interaction until very recently
[2021-11-30T17:57:54.646Z]	<juancaballero>	... I would imagine we're going to continue that activity as much as we can
[2021-11-30T17:58:12.587Z]	<juancaballero>	... and of course we'll continue this VC vocab work in the open so that people can engage at least on our side of the conversation
[2021-11-30T17:58:52.665Z]	<juancaballero>	... and the work-item team, all W3C members, could take the conversation via W3C liaison channels?
[2021-11-30T17:59:51.192Z]	<juancaballero>	Andrew: ISO works on "paper, in-person meetings, and formality" - liaison officers are the formal channel for these kinds of inputs.  I am such a liaison and there are others as well, I will look into seeing if anyone else wants to be designated for this
[2021-11-30T17:59:52.612Z]	<mprorock>	@andrew - would love to have that discussion re liaison - can you fire an email to the chairs on that topic?
[2021-11-30T18:00:04.083Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	+1 mprorock
[2021-11-30T18:00:18.431Z]	<juancaballero>	... a test suite and interop artefacts are always a welcome conversation-starter
[2021-11-30T18:00:27.135Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	"we all win together when the specs work together" Love it!
[2021-11-30T18:00:38.588Z]	<juancaballero>	... when the specs work as broadly as possible and as designed/imagined, this convo is easier to have
[2021-11-30T18:00:48.813Z]	<Heather_Vescent>	q?
[2021-11-30T18:00:58.659Z]	<juancaballero>	... and if there are use-cases or formats or transports needed for the mDL to be useful in the world, that's another good inroad to conversation
[2021-11-30T18:01:48.472Z]	<Juan_Caballero_(Spruce)>	thanks andrew! great stuff
[2021-11-30T18:02:10.064Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Thank you!
[2021-11-30T18:02:10.852Z]	<cel>	thanks

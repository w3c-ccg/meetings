Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<div class="information">&lt;simone_ravaioli&gt; Good morning, good afternoon everyone, welcome to today&apos;s W3C Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call, on Monday, July the 1st. Let&apos;s get started with the housekeeping items. IP Note: Anyone can participate in these calls. However, all substantive contributions to any Credentials Community Group Work Items must originate from members of the CCG with full IPR agreements signed. You can find the link to this in the meeting invites. You&apos;ll need to have a W3C account, that is also something easy to do online. Moving on to call notes. Please note that these meetings are recorded. We have a robot transcriber and we also make audio and video recordings, that are archived and available online. If you want to speak, please raise your hand, or add yourself to the queue by typing &#8220;q+&#8221; in the chat. And please be brief if you have a question to ask, we want to maximise the time for conversations. Thank you. Now to Introductions &amp; Reintroductions. If we have any new people in the call, or somebody would like to reintroduce themselves, please feel free to take the floor. If nobody wants to take the floor, we can move on to announcements and reminders.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:   Are people. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Asked all the time how do we get started with this uh the hype is real people see a lot of really cool use cases in education particularly um for verifiable credentials open badges is a great um flexible credential type that offers support for a whole lot of different uh learning claims that you might make and so people are excited about it they want to know like how do we get started what are the products that are available on the market that can issue this uh credential type and then they are advocating on behalf of their users and wondering what can you do with badges uh with these credentials once you&apos;ve got them um do they get accepted as part of job applications what do employers think of them are they integrated with uh employment uh applicant tracking systems and HR information systems for in for instance. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  And the answer is to a lot of these questions are that it&apos;s pretty early days within this um version of the spec and even open badges 2.0 the non-verbal credentials uh compatible version that came before uh there was a lot of implementation on the issuer side but not a huge amount of implementation on the consumption side so my recent focus in open badges has really been to try and push development towards the consumption verifying side for these credentials and to put them in products where they can actually become meaningful and um start providing real value for users rather than just being a digital token that&apos;s fun to look at nice visual symbol of achievement. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Yeah that that&apos;s that&apos;s an interesting Dynamic uh to be in in a market where there is demand for your product and you know there&apos;s like large institutions that are seeking Solutions there&apos;s large advertising budgets uh among some of the the products that are on the market but there&apos;s not a huge um. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Is not super well educated as to like what are the actual capabilities are and so there is a little bit of like a hype cycle dynamic um that happens in this space people are excited about the use cases they hear some big statements saying this is really useful for hiring you can represent all kinds of things with it and they you know fit their own imagination and their own use cases into these capabilities um they see oh yeah I want to recognize skills I want to recognize competencies. <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Um and I you know I think you can see a lot of the need for open badges in your own life and in the communities that you participate in um you can see that our communities could be better if we could better understand what the employment growth pathways are that go through them you know what are the roles here what skills are associated with those roles what learning opportunities can we access that would recognize those skills and the open badges uh credential type. <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Into a lot of those uh those stories you can see like oh yeah if only we had some badges that were um able to recognize the skills that were aligned to the same. <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>

<div class="information">&lt;naomi&gt; That&apos;s a GREAT question... I&apos;d like to offer some of the &quot;why&apos;s&quot; in a future session... we&apos;re seeing some really interesting applications and tangible benefits within Velocity Network. !!!</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  The jobs that people are looking for then people could see what the progression was between job a and job B and they could see where they could go get um education in order to be able to qualify for those jobs and so I think the power of the use cases is what&apos;s really driving the um excitement and now it&apos;s up to us as people who are implementing this technology to bring the products and to bring the ecosystem um to the level where it&apos;s really delivering on those use cases end to end providing value um for those users in the ways that they&apos;re excited about. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Hi um I&apos;m really excited for this AMA so I I think that like sort of bridging Bridging the old and the new is um something that I have a question about um both for not just like the like sort of like the why should we do this but the technically of the house and I&apos;m a little bit curious like what is the plan sort of moving forward on um you know whether version 3 is compatible with um bcdm version 2 or any future versions like what is like the workflow for making sure that um the open badges um specification remains compatible with the verifiable credentials um data model as it becomes like updated in the future and then sort of like reaching to the Past I&apos;m a little bit curious about um like you know like the badge connect API versus like BC API and like ways like if you&apos;re already issuing open batch version 2. <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:   To become a. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Thank you Sharon great cluster of questions there uh let me tackle the sort of future looking ones first and then I&apos;ll um switch my my focus and kind of look back at at this version transition that we&apos;ve made between major version 2 and major version 3 so looking ahead open badges is now a credential type that&apos;s compatible with verifiable credentials that will continue to be the case uh the the work group has done. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  The the work that they needed to to make it so that the open badges schema is compatible with both both VC 1.1 and VC 2.0 and if there is a a VC 3.0 the structure changes at some point in the future then um I would fully expect that the um the 1 at Tech group would make a necessary update to open badges so that you can express um the claims that you can make with open badges in whatever verifiable credential wrapper format that there is um a great example of how we&apos;re doing this recently um right before the finalization of of this new version open badges 3.0 we um. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  The uh various different pieces of the verifiable credentials data model and how we can make sure to stay as interoperable with the different choices that different implementation communities would be making as possible so we relaxed a few of the initial drafted um schema requirements in open Mages to make sure that um organizations that were implementing with verifiable credentials in ways that we hadn&apos;t quite foreseen would still be able to use more or less the full power of the verifiable credentials data model which means flexibility for um adding additional credential schema entries different evidence types different signature types and did types and um. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:   And all. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Like layers that you can plug in um we want to make it so that there is some pretty strong compatibility across the implementers in the ecosystem. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Also um enable the ecosystem to grow and to continue to be able to choose open badges as a um a schema for how to make learning claims about the types of things that open badges can cover you know everything from degrees down to competency recognition to attendance Badges and and participation and and peer endorsement. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Um so I think these these Technologies are together now um open badges has really found its Niche within the verifiable credentials data model it&apos;s a credential type you know the open values of community is not too particular about which cryptographic signature proof types should be used um Etc other than to try and push common implementers toward um implementing common solutions for compatibility we really want to make sure the badges that are issued can flow to where they need to go um but beyond that um a lot of the other layers of the text stack are in great hands uh in the the w3c and um in the various different parts of the credentials community group that are drafting new uh cool capabilities that we might be able to um put into Market. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;ildiko_mazar&gt; @Nate, do you know how many/what proportion of OB issuers reference skills in the badge metadata from skill or competence frameworks (as opposed to using free text descriptions)?</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Sharon do you have any uh reaction or or anything there um before I jump to kind of look at back at the past. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Um no that&apos;s cool so what I&apos;m hearing you say is that there&apos;s actually ongoing work um at 1 and Tech on um sort of updating and refining the standards so that it always remains consistent is that right. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Yeah absolutely and so uh I can go into a tiny bit more kind of on that which is that there is this uh 18-month cooling cycle at 1 Ed Tech before we can produce a new version of open badges but certain changes are Exempted from that so um we want there to be some stability in the market so we&apos;re not going to do a new revision right away um but when a new did method comes along or a new um proof type that we want to take a look at um the work group can add those as an additional recommendation of something that could be used um in a fairly lightweight Manner and so the work group will continue its work meeting twice a month. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  To discuss you know what are the use cases that are out there that we&apos;re seeing in the implementation landscape and to be able to make that type of small adjustments. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Cool and is there a way that um you know other people from the outside can be observers of that process just to you know see what you all are up to other than you know sort of like inviting you for an AMA every now and again. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Well I I do appreciate the invitation to join for an AMA uh and there are a number of other members of the the work group who are on these these calls regularly so there is a lot of information sharing so I wanted Tech is a member organization and um most of the official deliberations are members-only voting as member is only for instance however we have um. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  This community opened Badgers Community has advocated for very long time that the work on open badges should be done in the public and so our GitHub repository um for the open badges specification is a public repository and issues are discussed their poll requests are discussed there so you can follow along the actual issues and pull requests and anyone may open an issue um or comment on an issue so a lot of the the actual nitty-gritty work does have that Avenue of of visibility and then in addition there are some conferences um wanted to take puts on um a number of them they had they just got through the learning impact Conference in June and then um the big 1 for digital credentials every year is their digital credentials Summit which next year will be in Phoenix I think in March. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Covers a handful of scenarios for what such an issue or could do and the Crux of the difference is that open badges 2.0 largely relied on a phone home approach where the issuer would host a verification file on their own website and that URL of that file would which was the up-to-date version of the credential would be um included in the credential and then a verifier the instructions were instead of verifying a signature you just throw away everything else you have go fetch that the URL to the thing and that is the canonical copy of the um the credential and so if it was revoked he&apos;ll be able to see that if it um had changed uh since it was originally issued um you you would be able to see that as well. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>

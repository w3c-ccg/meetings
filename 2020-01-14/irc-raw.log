[2020-01-14T17:51:42.489Z]	<jonathan_holt>	kimhd_:  every one except manu seem lost.  perhaps we should move to another tool?
[2020-01-14T17:52:20.470Z]	<kimhd_>	q?

[2020-01-14T17:53:03.441Z]	<TallTed>	s/every one except manu seem lost/everyone except manu seems to forget why we're doing what we're doing/
[2020-01-14T17:53:18.583Z]	<jonathan_holt>	kimhd_: manu, should we try something else?
[2020-01-14T17:54:08.471Z]	<jonathan_holt>	manu: everyone would need space on w3c and may need to request tooling for that.  we will lose recordings. we would gain that other people can clean up the minutes.

[2020-01-14T17:55:59.927Z]	<jonathan_holt>	... the script is broken in a simple way.  but the burden would be on kimhd_ , everyone could submit the notes.  there is more interest in zoom.
[2020-01-14T17:56:47.267Z]	<jonathan_holt>	... pluses and minuses of moving to zoom.
[2020-01-14T17:57:03.732Z]	<jonathan_holt>	kimhd_ :  if we move to zoom, we don't have the log.
[2020-01-14T17:57:14.251Z]	<TallTed>	among other things with zoom -- someone would have to pay.  free calls cut off after ~40 minutes, and there are user count limits.

[2020-01-14T17:58:44.444Z]	<Carl_DiClementi>	personal anecdote: I do not find it easy to follow the minutes sent out via email in the current state. That does not mean moving aware from the current tooling will improve this scenario, just an observation.
[2020-01-14T17:59:40.722Z]	<jonathan_holt>	manu: someone is going to pick up the cost, current digitalB pays.  concerned regarding accessibility needs. can use IRC.  also cost with zoom.

[2020-01-14T18:01:09.142Z]	<kimhd_>	jonathan_holt: possible to use SIP integration with zoom? (would be additional cost)
[2020-01-14T18:01:24.891Z]	<jonathan_holt>	jonathan_holt: ? regarding SIP integration with zoom. but at a cost.
[2020-01-14T18:01:31.428Z]	<manu>	yes, lots of extra costs
[2020-01-14T18:01:51.064Z]	<manu>	and sip integration doesn't work for what we need it for

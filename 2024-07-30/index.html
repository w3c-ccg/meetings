<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We are but a bunch of people got kicked off so you might wait a bit including Calvin so you might wait a bit to um start. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;pl/t3&gt; many of us were :-(</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah thank you um Calvin and and Kyle for the presentation it&apos;s it&apos;s really um it&apos;s really neat work right I I think uh Singapore is is definitely far ahead of many other initiatives in the space when it comes to um you know being able to render this stuff being able to redact it uh using you know a custom UI for the individual to make it easy for them to understand um what they&apos;re reacting um uh there are a bunch of really neat uh you know features in here and it&apos;s great to you know that that um you&apos;re also engaging with the global standards process to enable this you know functionality for the the rest of the world um I&apos;m I&apos;m wondering what um kind of the focus uh for your team over the next uh 6 months to a year uh is going to be are there um things that are missing uh from. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Would like to fix do you have like a road map that you can share with us um. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I I think it would be really great I mean that was a great great answer on the the the privacy concerns implications part of it I think it&apos;s probably worth writing that up in the in the specification to to note that you know they&apos;re you know what those privacy implications are um because just now when you you know I&apos;ve taken a look at the PRS and the spec and all that kind of stuff and it didn&apos;t click until just now when you said what you did uh uh Kyle so um uh so that&apos;s great I mean I think that&apos;s a very defensible you know privacy position um as far as kind of you know roadmap is concerned I know that there are a number of us that would like to take the render method specification onto the standards track at the worldwide Web Consortium so it&apos;s great that uh your team is going to uh be there um because we&apos;ll need you know all the support that we can get to uh convince the w3c membership to uh put at least you know render method along with a number of other things. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Into the next Charter um uh the the the uh securing mechanism that you&apos;re talking about which I believe is like a Merkel tree proof based you know securing mechanism um is is that also of interest to put on the standards track the reason I I ask is because there are other selective disclosure mechanisms that are probably going to be Global standards um I know that there are differences in the way that you&apos;re employing kind of the the your selective disclosure mechanisms that are important um is that something also that you&apos;re interested in kind of pursuing on the global standards track or do you feel some of the other things that are being worked on like BBS um uh on linkable and selective disclosure or the ecdsa SD thing would would fit your use case as well um so so the general question is what are your thoughts on. <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="information">PL/T3: Manage comment um about on linkability uh led me to think about whether if an if a number of credentials are being rendered um to the same individual from the same institution it sounds like that is 1 is a potential issue that might be uh correlated to Identity um if there&apos;s uh if that&apos;s happening over time and I not sure that the comment about processing a lot of the JavaScript internally to the browser quite addresses that aspect but perhaps you can comment on that. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="information">PL/T3: Sure I mean I think the main thing is if there&apos;s if the if the party that we&apos;re talking about is a third party watching the transactions cross the cross the web and they&apos;re seeing these these transactions coming from this institution for a particular credential type um if there&apos;s any way for them to to um see that over time from multiple places for example because it&apos;s being rendered for different applications of employment from the different institutions the probability that you&apos;ll be able to start correlating that uh process. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>

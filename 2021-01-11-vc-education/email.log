<kimhd> Need to rework "ne bis in idem" section -- specify in the 
  scope of a given work item
<kimhd> Discussed whether single vs multiple (e.g. VC vs VP) is 
  in scope. Decided our focus for this work item is single.
<kimhd> Clarify that the goal is interoperability without 
  creating a new standard, new terms that already exist. Reuse of 
  existing standards where possible
<kimhd> Need to further clarify relationship to CLR, HR Open, 
  PESC

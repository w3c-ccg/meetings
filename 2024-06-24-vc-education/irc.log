[2024-06-24T15:09:00.575Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I work with mostly with mit's digital credentials Consortium.
[2024-06-24T15:09:08.135Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh where uh I'm I'm technical architect for an open-source Mobile Wallet.
[2024-06-24T15:09:11.082Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A uh issuer Suite.
[2024-06-24T15:09:26.134Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so UI and back-end services and a verifier Suite in addition uh I also help out the Arizona State University team on very similar uh kind of things so I work on uh their corner pocket.
[2024-06-24T15:09:35.591Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Mobile Wallet mobile credential wallet uh the issuer services they're verifiers and so on and I also help out.
[2024-06-24T15:09:43.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Um Phil Long with various projects uh for Chamber of Commerce for T3.

[2024-06-24T15:10:03.626Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So with MIT and and ASU continuing work on uh just adding features to the wallet uh and so we've got a open source Mobile Wallet written in um JavaScript in react native.
[2024-06-24T15:10:03.990Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  and we're.
[2024-06-24T15:10:06.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We're preparing it to.
[2024-06-24T15:10:21.835Z]	<Eric_Shepherd>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:10:27.647Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Handoff stewardship to the open Wallet Foundation uh which if you're not familiar with uh is uh part of the Linux Foundation uh it's a Linux Foundation project and its goal is not to write specifications it leaves that to the other species like ITF and w3c and ISO and so on.
[2024-06-24T15:10:30.116Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But it's it's mandate is to.
[2024-06-24T15:10:32.558Z]	<Stuart_Freeman>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:10:41.135Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And uh and curate a set of open-source libraries libraries and wallet implementations.
[2024-06-24T15:10:52.608Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh also it it work it's working on a sort of best practices and architecture and security sort of paper for wallets but but in general it's much like many other Linux Foundation projects.
[2024-06-24T15:10:55.578Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Like like the Apache foundation and so on.
[2024-06-24T15:11:03.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's it's goal is to uh sort of gather and Steward uh open source either.
[2024-06-24T15:11:11.151Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Full-on wallet implementations or component libraries so we've uh.
[2024-06-24T15:11:17.097Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We've been talking to the open world foundation and are in the process of migrating the.
[2024-06-24T15:11:26.099Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the learner credential wallet which is what the DC wallet project is called over to open Wallet Foundation.
[2024-06-24T15:11:31.098Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so we'll we'll MIT will continue sort of uh uh.
[2024-06-24T15:11:35.169Z]	<Stuart_Freeman>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:11:38.108Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Leading the software development uh as we can we're fairly small uh development team.
[2024-06-24T15:11:46.600Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But we're by moving it to the Linux Foundation we're inviting broader participation hopefully the project will be interesting to uh.
[2024-06-24T15:11:48.576Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Other teams as well.
[2024-06-24T15:11:57.450Z]	<PL/T3>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:12:05.640Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So if anybody has uh questions about the wall Foundation uh please feel free to ask in chat or queue up I'm probably not the best person to uh answer them but we can we can get your we can forward them to the open world Foundation folks and and.
[2024-06-24T15:12:08.593Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh get your questions answered.
[2024-06-24T15:12:12.218Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The stuff that we've been working on is uh.
[2024-06-24T15:12:17.691Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah so basically cleaning house for uh.
[2024-06-24T15:12:29.194Z]	<Andy_Griebel>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:12:32.192Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: B batching up uh various like warnings and errors and uh Tech debt uh in order to invite guests over for learning credential wallet that's handing off the.
[2024-06-24T15:12:34.592Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh open source wallet.
[2024-06-24T15:12:41.599Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To the broader Community uh and aside from that have been working on um.
[2024-06-24T15:12:49.616Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Issuer Suites uh to um Consortium member universities.
[2024-06-24T15:12:55.586Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We we've kicked off the.
[2024-06-24T15:13:02.624Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh quote unquote trust Registries project I think quote unquote because trust Registries is.
[2024-06-24T15:13:05.053Z]	<Andy_Griebel>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:13:08.109Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Kind of a a controversial and um not the best name.
[2024-06-24T15:13:14.112Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In in our credential Community for the thing that we're studying and what do we mean by trust registries.
[2024-06-24T15:13:19.574Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So anybody dealing with credentials in the.
[2024-06-24T15:13:23.623Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Space but really in any space this this absolutely.
[2024-06-24T15:13:29.570Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Covers any sort of credentials or anytime you sign an object digitally.
[2024-06-24T15:13:38.263Z]	<Andy_Griebel>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:13:40.121Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Because what's a signature right you're you're signing it essentially with a cryptographic key or with another a baked identifier like it did at decentralized identifier.
[2024-06-24T15:13:45.075Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And which which brings all sorts of useful properties.
[2024-06-24T15:13:56.624Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But the major challenge with digital signature is that they identifiers opaque when you're receiving a credential you don't know who the key belong to that you signed it with.
[2024-06-24T15:14:01.121Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And so you must necessarily.
[2024-06-24T15:14:23.131Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Have access to directories to lists of known issuers so you can say okay this key belongs to this University or this key belongs to uh this particular company or even an individual person right we're in the area of Education we're interested in.
[2024-06-24T15:14:26.599Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2024-06-24T15:14:29.098Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Self issued credentials which presents its own.
[2024-06-24T15:14:32.672Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's kind of interesting challenges in terms of.
[2024-06-24T15:14:36.597Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If we can get issuers.
[2024-06-24T15:14:45.126Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Companies and organizations on a list what about uh natural persons so we can we can talk about that what some of the techniques there.
[2024-06-24T15:14:48.593Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But anyway so.
[2024-06-24T15:14:53.592Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Regardless of what you do with credentials regardless of what technology stack.
[2024-06-24T15:14:55.626Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What sort of uh.
[2024-06-24T15:14:58.602Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Specifications you're using.
[2024-06-24T15:15:06.143Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You're going to need to have access to these directories to these lists of known issuers and that's what we mean by trust registry.
[2024-06-24T15:15:17.595Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh at at Baseline it is a list mapping opaque identifiers to known entities of course that that's not all that is that it can be.
[2024-06-24T15:15:25.869Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Industries can have other Advanced um features such as they can carry.
[2024-06-24T15:15:30.547Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: About what kind of verification steps were taken.
[2024-06-24T15:15:40.394Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Get the entity on that list uh meaning we performed full uh personal kyc the know your customer.
[2024-06-24T15:15:43.382Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Terminology from from Financial world.
[2024-06-24T15:15:52.918Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We can say that okay this is our governance framework and in order to get it on this list you have to meet these criteria and this is these are the verification steps we're going to take.
[2024-06-24T15:15:57.941Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All of these things to raise the confidence level of the verifier.
[2024-06-24T15:16:02.426Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: When they're hopefully will be accepting your credentials in the future.
[2024-06-24T15:16:08.460Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Aside from a base level this is a list of identifiers.
[2024-06-24T15:16:12.928Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: These Registries have uh lots of other useful features.
[2024-06-24T15:16:23.014Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To the ecosystem and so uh credential engine and uh digital credentials Consortium and many other many other groups uh have have.
[2024-06-24T15:16:32.996Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Joined into this uh 1 year uh research projects uh or or practically research project where essentially we're comparing.
[2024-06-24T15:16:35.992Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Um half a dozen to a dozen.
[2024-06-24T15:16:39.502Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Testing or in progress specifications.
[2024-06-24T15:16:44.984Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Because all these groups working with uh credentials Registries have have run into this problem.
[2024-06-24T15:16:52.008Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Registries that means we need a data model and sometimes we need a protocol or an API.
[2024-06-24T15:16:54.021Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Switch to interface them with.
[2024-06-24T15:16:57.995Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And that leaves implementers like us.
[2024-06-24T15:17:09.607Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: With lots of questions okay I'm entering into this world I have a wallet or I have a verifier or I have an issuer which 1 of these trust registry specifications do we use.
[2024-06-24T15:17:33.117Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And there's there's already uh a handful of choices so 1 of the 1 of the goals of This research project is we'll be uh simply comparing the specifications and trying to make sense of them these are the trade-offs that they're making uh this is a data model specification this is uh just an API these are the affordances they have for uh how to specify governance.
[2024-06-24T15:17:38.590Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How terms of service how to get on that list and how to get off that list and how to.
[2024-06-24T15:17:44.094Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All the information is outdated how do I simply change.
[2024-06-24T15:17:47.086Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the information right all of these things need to be.
[2024-06-24T15:17:54.085Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thought through so the trustee project will be comparing the specifications.
[2024-06-24T15:17:58.097Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Selecting 1 1 or 2 and.
[2024-06-24T15:18:15.156Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Standing up and implementation a a sample registry that we can operate for a while uh use in our wallets and issuers so that we can report uh knowledgeably that okay so this is what it's like to operate 1 of these these These are the downsides these are the the caveats.
[2024-06-24T15:18:18.111Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So as a sort of service to the community.
[2024-06-24T15:18:22.087Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So that's uh that's 1 of the projects but.
[2024-06-24T15:18:25.124Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh does anybody else have uh.
[2024-06-24T15:18:32.246Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The discussion uh things that they're working on they want to share.
[2024-06-24T15:18:37.263Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Hop on the list Naomi please go ahead.
[2024-06-24T15:19:38.194Z]	<Transcriber>	Naomi: Hi there hi Dmitri um you said some interesting things and uh we'd love to stay in touch with you not only about the trust Registries I think that that was 1 thing um velocity had been inquiring around earlier um in terms of certain lists that we've seen that we were curious about how we could incorporate them into the network so that's definitely and of course we have our own tools so we definitely love to stay in touch with you on that um another um thing that you mentioned of Interest was the wallet the open wallet and um working with the Linux Foundation I'd love to follow up with you on that as well velocity had a couple components of its organization that we were interested in connecting with Linux and maybe there is some dovetailing of interests in terms of your work with um the wallet and uh Linux foundation so um would love to follow up with you on those 2 points but in addition you know you started this um opening up you know the announcements recent events and our CTO on.
[2024-06-24T15:19:38.817Z]	<Transcriber>	Naomi:  race did.
[2024-06-24T15:20:09.159Z]	<Naomi>	https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/empowering-self-sovereign-identity-with-trusted-credentials-exploring-velocity-network-checks
[2024-06-24T15:20:13.674Z]	<Transcriber>	Naomi: At 1 of the diff um events specifically on uh empowering self Sovereign identity with trust credentials um I did post it on LinkedIn it kicked off on Thursday um but what I'll do is I'll put in the chat at least some of his recent writings and you know everyone on this call may have ideas or thoughts or feedback on that so I'll put um some of his recent writings and blogs in the chat for anyone who kind of wants to read velocities latest opinion um and then the other thing I'll put in the chat again is um.
[2024-06-24T15:20:22.242Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Thanks, Naomi.
[2024-06-24T15:20:26.643Z]	<Naomi>	https://www.velocitynetwork.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Recommended-LER-technical-and-functional-requirements-Sep-2023-.pdf
[2024-06-24T15:21:14.723Z]	<Transcriber>	Naomi: Um our Lear uh infrastructure requirements and this was kind of an early Doc and it was retrofitted I think for the Lear term being used in the US I think otherwise um it's almost like a Manifesto of some of velocities core beliefs in terms of why it works the way it works I just think that as a return this corner and we're starting to invest in various products that educate us on the notion of trust it might be a helpful document for everyone to have and and and opine on so um I just stuck those 2 in the chat and um we have a lot going on in velocity Network Foundation as well if anyone's interested in hearing more specific updates um I I believe we'll be publishing like a a quarterly or a 6-month kind of outward-facing newsletter on some of the big changes in velocity in the next week or so that hopefully everyone will take a look at and um be able to keep up on things happening in velocity network with all our members.
[2024-06-24T15:21:19.272Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thank you so much Naomi I really appreciate it.
[2024-06-24T15:21:40.824Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right well so while while people are uh searching their minds and um.
[2024-06-24T15:21:43.318Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Hopefully getting on the queue.
[2024-06-24T15:21:49.300Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I want to introduce a topic that's always near and dear to my heart which is self issued credentials.
[2024-06-24T15:21:54.828Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh I think we've we've talked a bit about we presented on.
[2024-06-24T15:22:03.336Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: On this topic I think with Phil Long on the on the subject on the work that we're doing with link credentials author.
[2024-06-24T15:22:10.805Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In the future on an open source uh resume author demo.
[2024-06-24T15:22:14.287Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh but the reason I bring these up is that.
[2024-06-24T15:22:26.311Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We've essentially got these 2 Worlds these 2 aspects of our of our credentials uh we have the in the classical institutionally issued credentials.
[2024-06-24T15:22:26.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  which what is.
[2024-06-24T15:22:28.132Z]	<Nate_Otto>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:22:28.762Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Does that mean it means.
[2024-06-24T15:22:35.802Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But it's an organization our company doing it and they're likely to be on a known issue or list somewhere.
[2024-06-24T15:22:44.357Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh whether it's by the government by the local Chamber of Commerce by uh some sort of uh third party.
[2024-06-24T15:23:05.011Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	:+1:
[2024-06-24T15:23:05.024Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Directory something like that right but then we have this whole other world of natural persons who are not likely to be on the list and in some jurisdictions like the European Union are specifically not legally allowed to be kept on list for privacy and and you know very very good legal reasons.
[2024-06-24T15:23:12.488Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Still want people to be able to.
[2024-06-24T15:23:25.024Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Selfish credentials and and for various reasons right so the first time the subject is brought up to people unfamiliar with the verifiable credentials uh the question immediately comes up.
[2024-06-24T15:23:33.515Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Why right what what business value what usefulness do we have in.
[2024-06-24T15:23:37.961Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Issuing a claim of some sort.
[2024-06-24T15:23:55.733Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	q+
[2024-06-24T15:24:00.010Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The answer to that is always well just like in the current non- digital credentials world right the the the business value of it greatly depends on the person greatly depends on their qualifications capabilities reputation in the community and so on.
[2024-06-24T15:24:05.554Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Ah I see we've got mahash on the Queue so I'll pause here Mah go ahead.
[2024-06-24T15:24:14.603Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2024-06-24T15:24:15.001Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But if you're talking you might be muted.
[2024-06-24T15:24:21.445Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: He's showing us unmuted here though.
[2024-06-24T15:24:24.962Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But we can't hear you otherwise.
[2024-06-24T15:24:27.965Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or at least I can't hear you it could be a network partition.
[2024-06-24T15:24:31.946Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh if somebody else can hear my hash let us know in chat.
[2024-06-24T15:24:33.475Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	I will rejoin
[2024-06-24T15:24:34.272Z]	<PL/T3>	Nope no voice from Mahesh
[2024-06-24T15:24:38.490Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay so my my hash is going to reconnect all right.
[2024-06-24T15:24:43.696Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So yeah so so sufficient credentials.
[2024-06-24T15:24:59.261Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the value of this credential uh greatly depends and 1 of the things that we're we're claiming in in starting this project with Phil Long and others of uh.
[2024-06-24T15:25:05.239Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I'm making more widely available tools for natural persons to.
[2024-06-24T15:25:14.200Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Easily create verifiable credentials 1 of the things that that we're we're claiming and and are investigating as part of this project is.
[2024-06-24T15:25:18.692Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Our thesis is that.
[2024-06-24T15:25:24.680Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The value of self issue credentials can be greatly increased.
[2024-06-24T15:25:26.527Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	I am one of those individuals who has genuine interest in self-issued credentials as a lifelong non-formal learner couldn't expect an Agent to formally/informally issue credentials proving one's knowledge, skills and competences.
[2024-06-24T15:25:26.684Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: With 2 things.
[2024-06-24T15:25:29.680Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 is evidence.
[2024-06-24T15:25:33.216Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Let's say this is a uh.
[2024-06-24T15:25:37.697Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Stuff is should claim of skills or uh.
[2024-06-24T15:25:45.332Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or a an employment history item right the things that make up potentially make up a resume.
[2024-06-24T15:25:46.512Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2024-06-24T15:25:53.827Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The veracity and the value of that can be greatly increased with just adding to the credential.
[2024-06-24T15:26:05.306Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I'll link to uh a video where you demonstrating that skill a link to uh an external non digitally science certification a uh.
[2024-06-24T15:26:16.827Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A code repository right literally evidence of the claim that you're making and then the second thing that that that we think greatly increases the value of the claim is of course.
[2024-06-24T15:26:31.997Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	present+
[2024-06-24T15:26:36.836Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Recommendations endorsements uh comments on the claimed by other people and and in the verify the credential world we have these general purpose mechanisms uh that that we're hoping to see wider use so 1 of the things that we're we're trying to demonstrate is the user interface and the data model.
[2024-06-24T15:26:42.292Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: On 1 approach and how this can be done uh by Sima hash has um.
[2024-06-24T15:26:45.501Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh rejoined us so go ahead Mash.
[2024-06-24T15:26:48.100Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: Can you can you hear me let me.
[2024-06-24T15:26:48.809Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yes we can hear you go ahead yeah.
[2024-06-24T15:26:50.436Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Using common standards to convert what would normally be on a single-language un-structured CV, can this way become a multi-lingual, machine readable verifiable cradential.
[2024-06-24T15:27:02.130Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2024-06-24T15:27:06.126Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	ack mahesh
[2024-06-24T15:27:18.223Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: All right sorry um um I just um I think I I missed the there was probably uh presentation on ASU pocket and the tln network maybe 2 weeks back uh and uh I was wondering if it's possible for you or somebody else uh who was there to give a quick summary of uh where the progress is I'm very interested in that particular project uh it's right uh right in my backyard thank you.
[2024-06-24T15:27:20.277Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thank you Mahesh.
[2024-06-24T15:27:24.782Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who who wants to give a summary of uh the ASU presentation.
[2024-06-24T15:27:33.288Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We should have a recording uh up in the minutes.
[2024-06-24T15:27:37.786Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	@Mahes, we are sill to deliver the Pocket presentation.
[2024-06-24T15:27:52.287Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Ah okay so so uh mentioned so the ASU pocket presentation uh was scheduled for previously but had to be moved uh due to speaker.
[2024-06-24T15:27:58.127Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So that's coming up so you haven't missed anything yet.
[2024-06-24T15:28:00.089Z]	<Transcriber>	Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com: All right great thank you so much yeah.
[2024-06-24T15:28:06.986Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Any other questions any questions about the uh.
[2024-06-24T15:28:10.945Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Notion of self-assured credentials on.
[2024-06-24T15:28:11.521Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	The recording of the LER session can be found at: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2024-06-03-vc-education/
[2024-06-24T15:28:20.497Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh have any of you either implemented a wallet or have used the wallet that has included tools to create self issued credentials you'll go ahead.
[2024-06-24T15:29:27.208Z]	<PL/T3>	Ildiiko self-issue credentials are simiilarly 'sealed' cryptographically  when they are created.
[2024-06-24T15:29:56.234Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thanks so the account and yeah it's a it's a tough technological problem how do you electronically sign how do you seal these self issued credentials again not that it's difficult to sign.
[2024-06-24T15:30:01.193Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh to to create a signature it it's 1 function call right.
[2024-06-24T15:30:12.234Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Signing part is Trivial technologically what's not trivial what what I suspect is referring to and and what 1 of the things that uh we're investigating with Phil long is.
[2024-06-24T15:30:20.251Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Once it's signed how do you get the key or the identifier in a directory somewhere how do you.
[2024-06-24T15:30:23.570Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	EDCs must be signed by an eIDAS compliant electronic seal (can't be sealed by an individual's electronic signature). It's a trust issue.
[2024-06-24T15:30:24.207Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How do you hook into the known issue or mechanism.
[2024-06-24T15:30:24.542Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  how do you.
[2024-06-24T15:30:26.693Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To identify the person.
[2024-06-24T15:30:30.714Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And again in the case of uh.
[2024-06-24T15:30:35.208Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Classic universities companies uh other providers.
[2024-06-24T15:30:41.225Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah so as a Zelda mentions in um in chat in the European Union model.
[2024-06-24T15:30:47.723Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh credentials must be signed by an EIT compliant electronic seal which means.
[2024-06-24T15:30:56.720Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What does that mean it means that the issuer has to be on a registry on a list this year has had to have gone through.
[2024-06-24T15:30:58.994Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  uh organ.
[2024-06-24T15:31:01.200Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Organizational identity verification.
[2024-06-24T15:31:14.059Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So again and since those uh identity verifications are for organizations and and cannot be uh sort of by legislation uh with natural persons what do we do about people.
[2024-06-24T15:31:22.983Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That there's let's talk about what what the options are and then uh some guesses on what the.
[2024-06-24T15:31:25.507Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Well some of the solutions could be alright so.
[2024-06-24T15:31:28.164Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	And how can third party viewers trust the content of credentials if they contain claims about the issuers themselves.
[2024-06-24T15:31:29.018Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the trivial option is of course.
[2024-06-24T15:31:37.814Z]	<Nate_Otto>	My project ORCA enables self-claiming of credentials within the governance rules of a community, but the community (currently using did:web) is the issuer and signer. I haven't yet seen any wallets that are really enabling self-issuing and signing with a key associated with the same ID (e.g. did:key) that they use to receive credentials. I'm sure we'll see some self-issuing features in wallets eventually.
[2024-06-24T15:31:41.908Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah so as I mentioned in chat uh how can third-party viewers trust the contents of the credentials if they are self claimed if their claims about the issues themselves.
[2024-06-24T15:31:55.500Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah that's that's the key question how do we get the signature on a directory somewhere or at least how do we identify who the signer was and then how does the verifier trust the claims.
[2024-06-24T15:32:01.321Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And there's a couple of options uh in terms of uh increasing Trust.
[2024-06-24T15:32:04.826Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 is again evidence.
[2024-06-24T15:32:08.835Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You don't just like in the non-credentialed.
[2024-06-24T15:32:09.130Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  you don't.
[2024-06-24T15:32:19.880Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Don't take people's uh word just at face value you also asked to provide evidence evidence of the skill evidence of the project completion of the output.
[2024-06-24T15:32:22.345Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And in addition.
[2024-06-24T15:32:29.491Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We have these well-known mechanisms of letters of recommendation letters of endorsement uh.
[2024-06-24T15:32:32.450Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We have the.
[2024-06-24T15:32:49.519Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh references available upon request at the end of a resume which realistically means that somebody in HR is going to call up your uh previous manager previous teammate and and and just try to.
[2024-06-24T15:32:55.468Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Confirm what you claimed again the the reason that.
[2024-06-24T15:33:07.732Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Self issued claims are valuable uh is really easy to demonstrate a resume is nothing but a collection of self-assured claims.
[2024-06-24T15:33:13.230Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is valuable absolutely that that is how so much of our employment world.
[2024-06-24T15:33:34.010Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh rests on so what we're what we're sort of competing against what we're what we're racing against is can we provide in these digital signatures in these digital credentials can we provide equivalent or hopefully more value than a regular paper resume uh go ahead elico you're on the queue.
[2024-06-24T15:34:24.569Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah excellent point thank you for bringing that up uh thank you for bringing that let's talk about that so.
[2024-06-24T15:34:46.644Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: As as a brief side note about is it better than a paper resume uh 1 of my favorite essays uh from uh I think early 2000s Was Won by uh Joel spolsky who is incidentally um the founder of the company that created stack Overflow as well as Trello and and a couple other things uh.
[2024-06-24T15:34:52.492Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Great guy wrote a lot about uh issue tracking and uh managing Developers.
[2024-06-24T15:34:52.955Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  1 of the.
[2024-06-24T15:34:53.261Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: See what we said.
[2024-06-24T15:35:05.562Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is in developing an issue tracker you're not just competing against jira or Microsoft or other people that are providing the software you're competing against.
[2024-06-24T15:35:09.060Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: An open notepad file.
[2024-06-24T15:35:22.148Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You're competing against uh just a simple file in a text editor I always think about that uh in in the area of credentials especially when employment and ress I always think just like when creating a software are you better than.
[2024-06-24T15:35:33.192Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Open text file in terms of jotting down notes Here Again the question is can we be better than a paper resume and as Elder Co points out.
[2024-06-24T15:35:57.239Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The 1 of the low-hanging fruit 1 of the sort of holy Grails of this whole field is not just the digital signature the value of verifiable credentials whether institutionally issued or self issued is not just a signature it's not just the reputation that the issuer brings to the table it's the fact that it is structured data what do we mean by that so.
[2024-06-24T15:36:04.164Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh if you look at the world of data uh as a developer there's essentially only 2 kinds of data.
[2024-06-24T15:36:08.178Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Raw text or unstructured text.
[2024-06-24T15:36:08.530Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  this is what you.
[2024-06-24T15:36:19.202Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Get when I don't know you write an email or you scan in an ebook or you scan in a resume right you're applying to a job portal and it's like.
[2024-06-24T15:36:29.788Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Upload your resume in word or PDF format there that's on structured data it's uh long paragraph of text meant to to be for human consumption.
[2024-06-24T15:36:33.244Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But what does an analytical system.
[2024-06-24T15:36:35.750Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What does machine readable code.
[2024-06-24T15:36:53.836Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What can go do with that and of course now these days we have large language models we have uh AIS with with all of their benefits and um and drawbacks and and part of the reason why there is such hype about AI is that they let us.
[2024-06-24T15:36:59.183Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Text free form text.
[2024-06-24T15:37:03.282Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Scanned in resume into hopefully.
[2024-06-24T15:37:12.863Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This is still being demonstrated a number of experiments the hope is that we can turn that unstructured text into structured data what do we mean by that.
[2024-06-24T15:37:16.162Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Very-very true. And while I fear that we won't see many self-claimed degrees floating around :-), in today's world where so much learning is happening non-formally, documenting skills in ANY way, has great advantages (without legally binding signatures).
[2024-06-24T15:37:23.496Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We mean machine readable records we mean uh fields that are defined uh we we're all familiar with these records the these are.
[2024-06-24T15:37:49.193Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh anytime you fill out a form or or use a spreadsheet uh although form is slightly better example than a spreadsheet right uh this is where columns and fields are defined the data structure is known and the receiver knows what to do with it it knows that this field is a name this field is um the name of the place that you worked and this field is how long you worked there that sort of thing.
[2024-06-24T15:37:58.148Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In general 1 of the 1 of the main value propositions of verifiable credentials is.
[2024-06-24T15:38:06.624Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Usually the issuer or the implementer of the software that was used to to create this thing.
[2024-06-24T15:38:15.193Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Did the the cognitive work and the user interface the hard ux work of.
[2024-06-24T15:38:18.127Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Turning this record into.
[2024-06-24T15:38:30.140Z]	<PL/T3>	person identity - notarization is the personal identity verifidation.

Great point Dmitri. Are we over interpreting the value of a corporate or non-profit entity's assertions over self-issued claim?  Structured data helps narrow the gap. But the additional processes behind which the experiences by which a claim of skill  was acquired follows 'best practices' that are considered more likely to increase acquisition of the skill, and have assessments made along the way to measure that.
[2024-06-24T15:38:31.701Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Something that just meant for for human ball into structured data which means that it's actionable hopefully if you have the right system it's actionable uh now let's see there's some good good comments in chat um.
[2024-06-24T15:38:33.637Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sounds very true.
[2024-06-24T15:38:39.159Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We won't see many self-claimed degrees.
[2024-06-24T15:38:44.177Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Much learning is happening non formerly yeah absolutely absolutely.
[2024-06-24T15:38:48.150Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh Phyllis pointing out that uh.
[2024-06-24T15:38:54.674Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In in terms of uh personal identity in terms this is the issue that we're talking about earlier.
[2024-06-24T15:39:02.233Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How do we know who the credential is from 1 of the very powerful Tools in this uh toolkit is.
[2024-06-24T15:39:19.214Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh infrastructure right like we're all hopefully familiar with no Republic uh which is if you think about it an interface between the formal world of government and bureaucracy and the messy human.
[2024-06-24T15:39:33.252Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's no no much like LM is a mechanism to turn on structure text into hopefully structured in a way notaries are a mechanism.
[2024-06-24T15:39:39.206Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or at least partially.
[2024-06-24T15:39:48.706Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Selfish should claims into witnessed and verified claims and giving them uh a set of structure and formality.
[2024-06-24T15:39:53.700Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Now let's see uh there's also an excellent comment from Nate.
[2024-06-24T15:40:07.301Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That I think I may have missed as the transcriber was scrolling the documents ah Nate was talking about project Orca enabling self claiming of credentials within the government's rule of a community.
[2024-06-24T15:40:13.263Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh I haven't seen any wallets ah scrolled off uh Nate uh please feel free to hop on the.
[2024-06-24T15:40:19.246Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: On the Queue we'd love to hear about uh your project and and it's a a really good point that uh there is.
[2024-06-24T15:40:32.875Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's not a binary ahnaf between uh traditional institutions and and people we have many other nodes in the middle such as a a given Community whether it's a uh.
[2024-06-24T15:40:39.427Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: AA club and Association uh and so on I'm sure you can explain it better.
[2024-06-24T15:40:41.434Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But it's an excellent point.
[2024-06-24T15:41:28.647Z]	<Transcriber>	Nate_Otto: Um so Orca is an open source piece of software that aims to be a badge platform for communities of practice whatever that community of practice is it could be uh sports team who primarily wants to have people show up to the pickup practices um or it could be a department of a university you know engaging in formal education and they can set up their achievements with whatever governance rule they like in terms of what it takes to earn them um and self claiming is is available so it's interesting to see the presence of many possible communities whether they're these tiny little things that may fly as spin up for a very small purpose or storied institutions that um last for hundreds of years.
[2024-06-24T15:42:03.083Z]	<Transcriber>	Nate_Otto: Um as intermediaries in the space that exists for the purpose of enabling people to self claim um the skills that they have and then get peer validation and endorsement from the other people in the community um it's 1 possible approach here I think it's also compatible with sort of pure self claiming where maybe you have some key material in a wallet somewhere and you're creating credentials signed by and to the same uh credential subject I haven't seen a whole lot of that happening yet although I'm sure that um we will as there are destinations for.
[2024-06-24T15:42:09.386Z]	<Transcriber>	Nate_Otto: To actually go and be turned back into real insights and real um.
[2024-06-24T15:42:14.476Z]	<Transcriber>	Nate_Otto: Uh actionable you know intelligence um like you said.
[2024-06-24T15:42:24.485Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thank you so much Nate yeah these are really excellent point uh from from Milo and Nate uh it'll go point that uh in addition to the difficulty of uh.
[2024-06-24T15:42:26.288Z]	<Naomi>	hi, I struggle with the level of effort required for self-reported or peer-attested credentials given that AI can make us less reliant on structured data. That said, love the idea of community feedback being mobile! We do have to be better than a piece of paper.
[2024-06-24T15:42:34.707Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Identity verification don't forget about the value proposition of structured data uh even even if self issued and then Nate bringing up several excellent points such as.
[2024-06-24T15:42:42.670Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 there's communities and and groups and all sorts of other issuers that could be potentially uh.
[2024-06-24T15:42:50.213Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Business value both of reputationally and and organizationally so so that's an excellent point and then uh as Nate mentioned um.
[2024-06-24T15:43:02.690Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We still shouldn't forget about individual people right we've got these wallets and what do wallets do they manage cryptographic Keys which means we have.
[2024-06-24T15:43:07.159Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Much of the infrastructure for people to manage their own keys.
[2024-06-24T15:43:17.691Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But that last mile that the difficulties of course had to identify them how do we get them on a registry that Maps a key to a person uh.
[2024-06-24T15:43:21.077Z]	<PL/T3>	I think those of us interested in self-issued credentials are trying to align existing formal organizational practices that in HE speak are often captured under the practices of accreditation. How do we enable individuals to have  forms of third-party assessment of the claims.
[2024-06-24T15:43:32.230Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 1 of the possible solutions was already mentioned by Phil Long and that is notaries right you you can use uh notaries as an active as a trust anchor uh where notaries can issue a notarization credential that says okay I checked this person's.
[2024-06-24T15:43:40.188Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And this key uh allegedly belongs to Demetrius aadan right so that's that's 1 option and then.
[2024-06-24T15:43:43.671Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the other option that I uh.
[2024-06-24T15:43:49.701Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So that is my personal suspicion that may play a role is of course address books.
[2024-06-24T15:43:53.688Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Meaning we all carry in all of our phones.
[2024-06-24T15:43:54.091Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  essentially I trust.
[2024-06-24T15:44:05.692Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right that we use to filter incoming phone calls that we this this person calling ah okay it's uh it's Grandma it's my car dealership whatever right.
[2024-06-24T15:44:27.538Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	How would this look like in a digitally signed credential? The self-signed cred is re-signed by the notary (envelope in envelope style)?
[2024-06-24T15:44:37.876Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They're identify they're opaque identifier the phone number is in my registry which is the address book right but the nice thing about uh even today's uh phone address books is that they have a bunch of fields emails uh address phone number and they all have we don't really use them it's not really used much but the capabilities there they all have fields to record identifiers and keys and so I definitely want to see more done with that but we've got uh more interesting conversation in chat.
[2024-06-24T15:44:38.817Z]	<PL/T3>	Personal recommendation graphs can become  the equivalent of address books
[2024-06-24T15:44:41.201Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Naomi mentioned level of effort.
[2024-06-24T15:44:53.417Z]	<PL/T3>	Q+
[2024-06-24T15:44:54.684Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right uh level of effort required for self-reported or peer tested credentials.
[2024-06-24T15:45:01.668Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh an excellent point pill Phil mentions that uh.
[2024-06-24T15:45:10.175Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Those of us interested in South Asia credentials are trying to um align existing formal organizational practices.
[2024-06-24T15:45:14.188Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then uh elico.
[2024-06-24T15:45:32.226Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How would this look how would this look like in a digitally signed credential the self-signed credential plus the notary uh excellent question and and we hope uh Phil and I hope to present on that in the future and I see.
[2024-06-24T15:45:32.422Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	What about x509 certificate extensions feature - I heard something about it in the last IIW
[2024-06-24T15:45:35.396Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh Phil Miku go ahead so.
[2024-06-24T15:46:07.951Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	@Mahesh - sure, so, 509x is just another signature / 'sealing' technology, definitely usable for credentials
[2024-06-24T15:46:35.564Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3: Yeah this is very helpful conversation actually for for those of us um uh like Nate and ourselves and others that are looking at how we try to transpose what institutions and corporate um in nonprofit art work corporate um mechanisms of impose of of uh either professional development or educational uh acquisition of Knowledge and Skills are have been doing for for centuries frankly um to into a world which is more unstructured and uh and less uh opaque less transparent I should say um and 1 of the things I think that we're continuing to harp on that is trying to bridge this Gap Demetri already mentioned and that is the presidents of third-party evidence and assessments that an individual can offer in in support of the claim that they're in that they're self asserting um so that there is uh there.
[2024-06-24T15:46:36.357Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3:  opportunity for.
[2024-06-24T15:47:37.566Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3: Entities whether they are um testing center or a in another individual with reputational value or other sorts of um of alignments that are more associated with uh formally structured issued credentials from an entity and organization that has at least in the higher education sense the Notions of accreditation that sort of check on the practices that are being used by which the acquisition is taking place to see if they conform to um things that are well known to um increase the probability that the acquisition claims is actually uh 1 that the person um is capable of to demonstrating in another in another context so I think that's where the the the issues are and any of us that are interested in this could the more sharing we do about possible Connections in this regard will help all of us and the last 1 that Dmitri mentioned was um the the context of the.
[2024-06-24T15:47:38.206Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3:  your address.
[2024-06-24T15:47:59.166Z]	<Nate_Otto>	How quickly could a verifier consume all of these forms of evidence? How much time will a reviewer take with each of individual's self-issued claims. Or is the relevant user imagined to be in the process of reviewing 300 resumes and unable to spend more than a minute on each one?
[2024-06-24T15:48:13.700Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	EXCELLENT question, Nate
[2024-06-24T15:48:14.275Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3: And in effect we've been talking about the idea of a personal recommendation graphs that 1 might be able to uh develop that are associated with particular dimensions of 1's types of skills that 1 that that 1 is claiming so that there is the this the start of at least of a collection that um facilitates a third another independent third parties opportunity to judge that self-claimed um with a set of things um that is more than just a random individual picked so thanks.
[2024-06-24T15:48:24.593Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Thanks Phil uh Nate brings up another excellent question chat how quickly could a verify consume all of these uh forms of evidence meaning.
[2024-06-24T15:48:35.602Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the the the promise of digital credentials is a sort of instantaneous uh verification process except it's not right so this is this is 1 of the.
[2024-06-24T15:48:44.113Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 of the fundamental insights uh we're all starting to have as a community in in implementing these credentials is that.
[2024-06-24T15:48:52.842Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We we don't want to oversell it as an instant uh verification human judgment still has to get involved even if it is.
[2024-06-24T15:49:10.879Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Upfront human judgment on which trust Registries do we pick so that if an ident if a signature from that uh entity shows up then we know we can trust it but in so many cases and as nay points out especially in uh self issue credentials and evidence.
[2024-06-24T15:49:19.854Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We're still going to need human judgment which is incidentally uh why it's super important to make sure that your issuing and verify your protocols.
[2024-06-24T15:49:23.819Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Deeply asynchronous that there can be.
[2024-06-24T15:49:37.879Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Minutes and hours and days and weeks between a submission for verification and a response back right we need to make sure to build into our protocols uh this essentially humans being involved.
[2024-06-24T15:49:43.832Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay so we've got uh almost nearing time.
[2024-06-24T15:49:54.868Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and we want to encourage uh everyone at the end of the call to uh re to reach out to us if you have a topic you want to speak on.
[2024-06-24T15:50:02.337Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right so we're uh as always we're looking for uh presenters and speakers on these weekly calls.
[2024-06-24T15:50:04.806Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so if you.
[2024-06-24T15:50:05.132Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  if you have a.
[2024-06-24T15:50:08.866Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Project you want to showcase a topic you want to present on uh please um.
[2024-06-24T15:50:20.312Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	dzagidulin@gmail.com
[2024-06-24T15:50:24.862Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh um email ildico email myself uh email Simone uh we'll drop some uh emails in the chat here here's mine and chair hers and so on uh please reach out to us.
[2024-06-24T15:50:25.118Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  okay but.
[2024-06-24T15:50:26.356Z]	<PL/T3>	It might be useful  to dig a little deeper into what attributes people associate with a well regarded 'brand' which institutionally issued credentials develop and are used as a proxy supporting trust in the assertions claimed.
[2024-06-24T15:50:26.885Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	ildiko.mazar@nttdata.com
[2024-06-24T15:50:30.343Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In the in the 10 minutes or so that's left I I want to make sure uh we highlight the.
[2024-06-24T15:50:34.827Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 2 things 1 is.
[2024-06-24T15:50:38.848Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Well I I I want to talk about.
[2024-06-24T15:50:50.889Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Again the value and the difficulty of structured versus unstructured data and fill in chat points out might be useful to dig deeper into what attributes people associate with well regarded brand.
[2024-06-24T15:51:05.899Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh that are used as proxy supporting trust in the assertions claimed yes absolutely I think that's that investigation is crucial to the whole field of verifiable credentials oh yeah and the other thing that I wanted to briefly address is just to answer all the questions uh what does.
[2024-06-24T15:51:21.434Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A notary or an endorser look like uh does a notary just uh add a signature to the existing uh credential or what uh and yes so adding a signature is always a solution but it's never the best solution uh.
[2024-06-24T15:51:29.890Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There fortunately verify the credentials have other mechanisms uh that are sort of the equivalent of uh the attached.
[2024-06-24T15:51:36.879Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I always find it helpful to think about uh real world processes on um.
[2024-06-24T15:51:46.890Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then and then mimic them in credential uh scum orphism so to speak right think about what the procedure for a notary is uh I have a document.
[2024-06-24T15:52:05.934Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Know uh self attestation about something and then I attached I include another separate document from the notary that says I reviewed this and and my notary number is this and here's my sign uh I have reviewed the attached right so even in the real world we have this notion of attachments and hyperlinks.
[2024-06-24T15:52:14.872Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We say things like the above the attached document and so on uh and so similar.
[2024-06-24T15:52:15.631Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	I'd also like to add to Phil's observation: at what level of data-richness we start seeing digital credentials as having high quality? We discuss this a lot in the ELM Team.
[2024-06-24T15:52:19.891Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Techniques can be used in the credential World by the notion of um.
[2024-06-24T15:52:28.901Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Links by the cryptographically secured or not uh attachments embedding and so on uh but that sounds like a great topic uh in general.
[2024-06-24T15:52:31.872Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: For another presentation uh but super quick.
[2024-06-24T15:52:34.859Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It turns out that.
[2024-06-24T15:52:42.369Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That that turning.
[2024-06-24T15:52:53.394Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Unstructured text even if it is a text in somebody's mind uh into structured machine actionable is actually really hard what do I mean by that.
[2024-06-24T15:52:59.876Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Think about developing a uh free form tool to issue.
[2024-06-24T15:53:07.378Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Self issued verifiable credentials which which is exactly what we're working on with Phil the the link claims author and the resume author.
[2024-06-24T15:53:14.890Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Think about if you're managing a development team or you're a developer and you're sitting down and your task is uh come up with.
[2024-06-24T15:53:23.904Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: John purpose tool or somebody can come and produce any kind of credential or but not just any kind of credential let's narrow it down let's say it's a skill assertion.
[2024-06-24T15:53:27.878Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This this tool is going to produce scale assertions.
[2024-06-24T15:53:48.431Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the trivial sort of solution is okay you have a form uh and it's like your name name of the skill the description of the skill what steps did you did you have to take to to get it do you have any sort of supporting evidence right so that's the.
[2024-06-24T15:53:49.188Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sort of the.
[2024-06-24T15:54:00.404Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Line you have these uh couple of fields but they're mostly unstructured because most of the value is still in the human readable text inside name of the scale.
[2024-06-24T15:54:03.868Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and description of the skill.
[2024-06-24T15:54:08.425Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Why is the name of the scale unstructured uh because.
[2024-06-24T15:54:25.534Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: People can refer to the same skill in in different languages right uh our our Dream as as developers as bureaucrats as as uh stewards of the ecosystem is always wouldn't it be great to link this skill to an existing skill.
[2024-06-24T15:54:31.762Z]	<Nate_Otto>	"our dream as bureaucrats" (the name of my new album)
[2024-06-24T15:54:34.549Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Like say that the government has okay this is a directory of skills that we recognize.
[2024-06-24T15:54:41.608Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A dream is bureaucrats as the name of a new album it would be an excellent album um.
[2024-06-24T15:54:50.422Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	1. reference skills from a published framework
2. associate volume to the learning
3. show proof of skill acquisition, including detailed description of the type/mode of assessment
[2024-06-24T15:55:01.503Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That that's 1 of The Avenues to for us to investigate can we tie the skills or any sort of self assertions into published Frameworks uh and the answer is well trivially yes but.
[2024-06-24T15:55:08.266Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	@Nate :-D :-D
[2024-06-24T15:55:10.730Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How to do it with the least friction and the least confusion on part of the user is an interesting topic that is worth a lot of Investigation.
[2024-06-24T15:55:29.849Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right but we are nearing time uh yeah excellent points in chat uh elico reference skills from published framework associate volume to the learning show proof of skill acquisition including detailed description of the type Mo motive assessment yeah.
[2024-06-24T15:55:30.824Z]	<Naomi>	Thank you for the call! -- informative.
[2024-06-24T15:55:33.746Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Anyway so my my whole point was that.
[2024-06-24T15:55:40.761Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The main value proposition is also turns out to be 1 of the hardest things uh to do in this field which is.
[2024-06-24T15:55:51.854Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How do you make the tax machine actionable in structured hopefully you're tying it into Frameworks uh but there's not that many good Frameworks so we're all sort of on the lookout of uh.
[2024-06-24T15:55:58.351Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Frameworks to use and then how to present that workflow to the user do we.
[2024-06-24T15:56:01.891Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Present a giant pulldown drop-down list.
[2024-06-24T15:56:13.283Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That says okay uh here's the 500 skills recognized by the state of Minnesota Select 1 right do do we do that or can we do something better.
[2024-06-24T15:56:15.507Z]	<PL/T3>	In the self-issued credential world, 3rd party testing centers may  emerge as of comparable value to institutional issuers....
[2024-06-24T15:56:19.862Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right any other uh last minute questions.
[2024-06-24T15:56:23.524Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Good point, Dmitri.
[2024-06-24T15:56:26.372Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Phil mentioned talks about the role of third-party testing centers May merge.
[2024-06-24T15:56:29.656Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2024-06-24T15:56:30.893Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Comparable value to institutional issuers yeah uh great great question.
[2024-06-24T15:56:35.875Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	ack pl
[2024-06-24T15:56:36.885Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh Phil do you have uh anything else uh to say I think.
[2024-06-24T15:56:39.425Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: On the Queue from previous.
[2024-06-24T15:56:50.458Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	A good taxonomy should definitely be more tree-like than a giant 'drop-down' list, in my opinion.
[2024-06-24T15:57:00.314Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	@Ildiko - definitely
[2024-06-24T15:57:20.484Z]	<Transcriber>	PL/T3: No I'm not not specifically I just think I I think what we're all struggling with is the ability to make this connection and do so in a way that doesn't impose on the individual who is making the self-assured claim the expectation of the knowledge and uh and expertise that affect assessment organizations and others that have been doing this for such a long period of time have developed uh in fits and starts over over tens of years we have to figure out a way that there's something that's good enough to convey the brand value recognition that a lot of people currently use who aren't even paying attention to all the things underneath the surface but just assuming them.
[2024-06-24T15:57:33.281Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right uh we are nearing the top of the hour we should wrap up I think the moral of the story here is that next time somebody wakes you up at 4 a.m. in the morning and says quick.
[2024-06-24T15:57:39.548Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	It was a great call, thank you, Dmitri.
[2024-06-24T15:57:41.253Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's the value proposition what are the difficult things of self issue credentials then you'll be able to answer them you can say.
[2024-06-24T15:57:44.257Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What are the hard parts.
[2024-06-24T15:57:57.297Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh unstructured thoughts into structured ones uh establishing trust in the self issuer uh presenting evidence and presenting endorsements and pulling all of that together in a.
[2024-06-24T15:58:02.308Z]	<Mahesh_Balan_-_pocketcred.com>	Thank you for the thoughtful discussion team VC-EDU
[2024-06-24T15:58:03.760Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: User-friendly way and if you can say all of that at 4 in the morning uh we we salute you.
[2024-06-24T15:58:08.226Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	:)
[2024-06-24T15:58:11.762Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: See you all hopefully uh the next week or since uh.
[2024-06-24T15:58:12.003Z]	<PL/T3>	coctail party opening lines ;-)

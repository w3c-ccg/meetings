[2020-08-25T16:19:50.409Z]	<econnell>	... information integrity is built in
[2020-08-25T16:20:09.117Z]	<econnell>	...can form relationships between documents
[2020-08-25T16:20:22.426Z]	<econnell>	... the notion of programability is highlighted
[2020-08-25T16:21:07.523Z]	<econnell>	... you can program content in the same way others program money and assets
[2020-08-25T16:21:35.252Z]	<econnell>	... records are signed by DIDs and stored on the blockchain
[2020-08-25T16:22:11.411Z]	<econnell>	...slide 5 - other benefits are global discoverability
[2020-08-25T16:22:31.314Z]	<econnell>	... you can traverse the graph for related content
[2020-08-25T16:22:58.787Z]	<econnell>	... auditability, imposability, create links between docs,
[2020-08-25T16:23:28.570Z]	<econnell>	... composability of content is important, any DID can be used
[2020-08-25T16:23:41.424Z]	<econnell>	... a network that does not provide lock in
[2020-08-25T16:24:20.178Z]	<econnell>	... DIDs can be controlled with crypto keys means data isn't trapped, horizontal scaleablity

[2020-08-25T16:27:34.407Z]	<econnell>	... documents slide - gives an overview of the lifecycle of a document
[2020-08-25T16:27:45.274Z]	<econnell>	... each doc has a docid, owned by DID
[2020-08-25T16:28:22.589Z]	<econnell>	... you can include uniqueness or randomness to avoid clashes in creating genesis record
[2020-08-25T16:28:49.524Z]	<econnell>	... once it is anchored, proof of blockchain record, then it is attached to the doc
[2020-08-25T16:29:02.958Z]	<econnell>	... updates can happen with one commit
[2020-08-25T16:29:11.891Z]	<econnell>	... you can have anchoring services
[2020-08-25T16:29:39.612Z]	<econnell>	...you have scalability in these different ways
[2020-08-25T16:29:59.797Z]	<econnell>	... doc types are more of less just programs that govern state mutations of docs
[2020-08-25T16:30:10.025Z]	<econnell>	... requires certain content format

[2020-08-25T16:32:45.218Z]	<econnell>	... you can have an index doc where keys are other ceramic docs
[2020-08-25T16:33:32.019Z]	<econnell>	... this structure provides a way for DIDs to provide mappings
[2020-08-25T16:34:47.263Z]	<econnell>	... users want a way to link many different accounts, and would like to manage encrypted data vaults, but don't want to rely only on servers
[2020-08-25T16:35:20.654Z]	<econnell>	... users for different use cases might want an optional layer with ceramic
[2020-08-25T16:35:51.307Z]	<econnell>	... you can create lists of users documents, to register DIDs
[2020-08-25T16:36:00.779Z]	<dbuc>	Are we conflating 'server' with 'piece of code that must run at a provider' - if so, I just want to note that nothing about EDV or Identity Hubs requires the latter
[2020-08-25T16:36:57.805Z]	<dbuc>	Not seeing how they would get the stream/throughput characteristics that you might want for many app use cases if all you could do is have your phone host your app backends
[2020-08-25T16:36:59.255Z]	<econnell>	... ceramic is live and available to check out, resources are there, code is on github
[2020-08-25T16:37:27.626Z]	<dbuc>	unless Verizon is cool with you basically eating 100s of TBs per month, along with basically melting your phone
[2020-08-25T16:37:32.759Z]	<econnell>	... github and discord have details

[2020-08-25T16:38:19.494Z]	<dbuc>	If course, we welcome work on Identity Hubs, if any of this is applicable to ingest as informative inputs

[2020-08-25T16:41:39.624Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: can you precisely contract how you see servers (using that term loosely), depending on use cases, it might take quite a bit to run that on your phone, how does that work?
[2020-08-25T16:41:55.112Z]	<econnell>	msena: depends on the use case
[2020-08-25T16:42:28.898Z]	<econnell>	... some information could run on mobile device, other information you would not want to, and keep that on another server system

[2020-08-25T16:42:49.938Z]	<dbuc>	The response seems to pose these as two different things, why is that?
[2020-08-25T16:42:55.826Z]	<econnell>	... provide a trusted open avail infrastructure for mappings and routings
[2020-08-25T16:42:57.417Z]	<dlongley>	query => ceramic => mediated/shared endpoints that point to EDV/Hub endpoints

[2020-08-25T16:43:30.549Z]	<econnell>	wayne: asking more about hubs, and can we look at use cases?
[2020-08-25T16:44:47.044Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: targeting use cases that half the apps on internet are fully public
[2020-08-25T16:45:04.483Z]	<econnell>	... first hit on piece of data are phone, and have side effects like battery life, etc
[2020-08-25T16:45:19.577Z]	<econnell>	wayne: what are jobs to be done by the hub?
[2020-08-25T16:45:43.372Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: specific to whatever the data is, like google keep or spotify
[2020-08-25T16:46:28.899Z]	<econnell>	... and, routes and relays messages
[2020-08-25T16:47:29.873Z]	<econnell>	wayne: what's the relationship between hubs and ceramic
[2020-08-25T16:47:53.139Z]	<kimhd>	ack agropper
[2020-08-25T16:47:54.433Z]	<dlongley>	i think ceramic allows discovery of hubs (and hubs use EDVs internally)
[2020-08-25T16:47:54.583Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: a shared effort to bring them together would be great
[2020-08-25T16:48:23.016Z]	<econnell>	agropper: would like to continue this discussion, mapping the world into policy decision points
[2020-08-25T16:48:52.494Z]	<dbuc>	dlongley: why would you not discover your Hub instance endpoints via your DID Document?
[2020-08-25T16:48:56.593Z]	<dbuc>	as a service endpoint
[2020-08-25T16:49:03.859Z]	<econnell>	... curious if both  daniel and michael would respond to how one would map a policy decision point model
[2020-08-25T16:49:08.218Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-08-25T16:49:14.984Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: policy is set by you
[2020-08-25T16:49:30.155Z]	<wayne>	https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Policy%20Decision%20Point <- context for those not familiar with PDPs/PEPs
[2020-08-25T16:49:45.424Z]	<econnell>	agropper: stipulating separating the data storage point v policy decision point
[2020-08-25T16:49:50.579Z]	<dlongley>	dbuc: for all the reasons discussed in the DID WG -- GDPR concerns with VDRs and so on ... and that you might want to include *additional* information about the DID before anyone wants to ever hit that service endpoint (like, include a VC from a commonly trusted source, for example)
[2020-08-25T16:51:01.357Z]	<econnell>	dbuc: multiple modalities, if you don't have a series of musts at every layer, the issue that could happen is everyone configures their hub differently, and then interoperability breaks down
[2020-08-25T16:51:13.185Z]	<econnell>	agropper: how does ceramic deal with this
[2020-08-25T16:51:57.336Z]	<econnell>	msena: ceramic allows use of textile threads, and ?
[2020-08-25T16:52:17.920Z]	<econnell>	... you can use DID managed docs to give you access to a server in various ways
[2020-08-25T16:52:28.779Z]	<econnell>	... users have another layer of control
[2020-08-25T16:53:51.668Z]	<econnell>	agropper: is it decentralized across the web itself?
[2020-08-25T16:53:55.164Z]	<kimhd>	q?
[2020-08-25T16:53:58.432Z]	<econnell>	msena: yes, exactly

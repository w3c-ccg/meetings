[2019-06-06T20:15:03.914Z]	<markus_sabadello>	JoeAndrieu: example: one rubric is whether there are people who are willing to take fiduciary responsibility

[2019-06-06T20:20:24.403Z]	<markus_sabadello>	mtfk_robert: DIDs issued by a central company like Facebook is something we don't want

[2019-06-06T20:52:17.075Z]	<drummond>	markus_sabadello: He also supports the need for the service-type parameter.
[2019-06-06T20:53:25.833Z]	<drummond>	...another use of service selection by type is for external parties to be able to programmatically select a specific kind of service without knowing the ID of that service endpoint.

[2019-06-06T21:00:54.319Z]	<drummond>	markus_sabadello: Introduced the case for the "key" matrix parameter by saying that it might seem redundant because you can select a key (or any other DID document object) using a fragment.
[2019-06-06T21:01:39.746Z]	<drummond>	kyle_denhartog: Asked whether a resolver would provide a standard error if there was a request for a specific key type
[2019-06-06T21:01:53.342Z]	<mtfk_robert>	For type empty array for id "null" or 404 ;)
[2019-06-06T21:02:26.244Z]	<drummond>	markus_sabadello: Errors in resolution are another topic

[2019-06-06T21:05:07.402Z]	<drummond>	markus_sabadello: Explained that while it seems like having a "key" parameter might be analogous to the case for a service parameter, however there is not the same case for being able to pass a service endpoint a path/querty/fragment.
[2019-06-06T21:06:06.148Z]	<drummond>	...so the primary reason for the "key" parameter would be if the DID URL author wants to address the key as a primary resource and not a secondary resource that's under a fragment.

[2019-06-06T21:07:51.141Z]	<markus_sabadello>	drummond: reason for "key" parameter: developers can construct DID URLs that refer directly to a "primary resource" (the key), rather than a "secondary resource" under the "primary resource" which is the DID Document
[2019-06-06T21:08:10.781Z]	<mtfk_robert>	q-
[2019-06-06T21:08:19.729Z]	<dmitriz>	I'd like to provide a counter-argument, though.
[2019-06-06T21:08:33.136Z]	<dmitriz>	in the DID Spec, when we say authentication: [ { id: "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1" } ]
[2019-06-06T21:09:48.139Z]	<rhiaro>	yeah, in jsonld/rdf at least, the uri is opaque. There's no such thing as primary/secondary resource just because the uri is a subset of another
[2019-06-06T21:09:51.643Z]	<markus_sabadello>	dmitriz: in the DID spec we consider those fragment references "primary resources", and we use them e.g. for "authentication" and "controller"
[2019-06-06T21:10:03.264Z]	<dmitriz>	+1 to what rhiaro said
[2019-06-06T21:11:50.302Z]	<markus_sabadello>	drummond: to kyle_denhartog: is there a need in HL aries / DIDComm to reference specific keys?
[2019-06-06T21:12:10.836Z]	<markus_sabadello>	kyle_denhartog: yes we need to reference specific keys; also at specific points in time, so we know exactly which key was used to encrypt a message
[2019-06-06T21:13:22.235Z]	<dmitriz>	using a point-in-time matrix param + hash fragment for key id would solve that use case though

[2019-06-06T21:14:30.380Z]	<drummond>	jonathan: favored being able to address it with a parameter so the fragment could be used for something else

[2019-06-06T21:19:01.761Z]	<dmitriz>	implementations who don't support any matrix param .. are compliant with a smaller subset of the spec.
[2019-06-06T21:19:06.740Z]	<markus_sabadello>	dmitriz: the risk is that may have linear explosion of matrix parameter, for every section of a DID document, including "authentication", etc. the hash fragment syntax already provides a generic mechanism for reference ANYTHING in a DID document
[2019-06-06T21:19:09.249Z]	<rhiaro>	dmitriz didn't someone just say they can't be optional?
[2019-06-06T21:19:35.840Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:19:51.247Z]	<drummond>	ack chrisboscolo
[2019-06-06T21:20:07.267Z]	<drummond>	chrisboscolo: Is "none of the above" an option?
[2019-06-06T21:20:16.664Z]	<kyle_denhartog>	@rhiaro yes, I did. I see you're point and will have to think about it more.
[2019-06-06T21:20:18.064Z]	<markus_sabadello>	chrisboscolo: one guiding principle should be simplicity
[2019-06-06T21:20:49.589Z]	<drummond>	...since we are designing security infrastructure, the simpler it is, the better. More doodads equals more chances to screw up.
[2019-06-06T21:20:52.458Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:20:55.132Z]	<markus_sabadello>	chrisboscolo: the more features we have, the more we risk bad implementations with security issues
[2019-06-06T21:20:58.647Z]	<drummond>	q+
[2019-06-06T21:21:00.677Z]	<rhiaro>	kyle_denhartog, there has been some discussion of this on the original PR which had all of the params in
[2019-06-06T21:21:41.375Z]	<drummond>	mtfk_robert: Asks if you can both a matrix parameter and a fragment. And can you address more than one.
[2019-06-06T21:21:45.642Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:21:48.905Z]	<markus_sabadello>	ack mtfk_robert
[2019-06-06T21:21:59.126Z]	<dmitriz>	according to our ABNF, yes, you can have both
[2019-06-06T21:22:25.378Z]	<mtfk_robert>	both means two fragment in the same time?
[2019-06-06T21:22:32.967Z]	<markus_sabadello>	q+
[2019-06-06T21:22:57.540Z]	<dmitriz>	ok, as far as two fragments, there's a separate spec. Which is a way to use query fragments inside hashes. So: url#key1=value1&key2=value2
[2019-06-06T21:23:21.603Z]	<dmitriz>	but I would definitely question the use case for that
[2019-06-06T21:23:25.416Z]	<drummond>	q/

[2019-06-06T21:24:30.009Z]	<drummond>	markus_sabadello: You cannot use a matrix parameter to select a key and a fragment to select another key.
[2019-06-06T21:24:49.748Z]	<drummond>	...however you could use a matrix parameter to select more than one key.
[2019-06-06T21:24:54.717Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:25:02.480Z]	<drummond>	ack markus_sabadello
[2019-06-06T21:25:13.909Z]	<drummond>	ack mtfk_robert
[2019-06-06T21:26:33.484Z]	<drummond>	mtfk_robert: could you have two fragments for selecting two different keys?
[2019-06-06T21:26:37.362Z]	<drummond>	drummond: No
[2019-06-06T21:27:24.093Z]	<dmitriz>	I agree, I'm also not sure we should support this
[2019-06-06T21:27:26.636Z]	<drummond>	mtfk_robert: so you would need matrix parameters to select more than one key
[2019-06-06T21:27:32.260Z]	<dmitriz>	cause now we're basically saying "how can I stuff two URLs into one"?
[2019-06-06T21:28:29.135Z]	<dmitriz>	why not just use an array?
[2019-06-06T21:29:52.950Z]	<chrisboscolo>	q+

[2019-06-06T21:30:33.148Z]	<drummond>	chrisboscolo: The more we hear questions about, "What does this mean", it's a clue as to whether it's really needed.
[2019-06-06T21:30:55.337Z]	<drummond>	...But wants to ask the question about key type—what it means.
[2019-06-06T21:31:28.760Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:31:29.920Z]	<mtfk_robert>	I think that the main point for key matrix parameter is that we need it as you can not have fragment for the service and the key in the same time.

[2019-06-06T21:33:44.677Z]	<drummond>	drummond: the key type should be defined completely in the key type registry
[2019-06-06T21:34:25.586Z]	<drummond>	mtfk_robert: the specification should be clear about exactly what the properties of a specific key type
[2019-06-06T21:34:29.069Z]	<markus_sabadello>	https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/
[2019-06-06T21:35:02.566Z]	<mtfk_robert>	https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/contexts/did-v1.jsonld < if you take a look here you will find this what markus posted above.
[2019-06-06T21:36:17.612Z]	<drummond>	chrisboscolo: Just looking for more context on why key-type might be used.
[2019-06-06T21:37:45.435Z]	<markus_sabadello>	drummond: Key types can be standardized via the registry, whereas key IDs may be different for every DID Document
[2019-06-06T21:38:16.120Z]	<markus_sabadello>	dmitriz: wouldn't we select keys using a query language?
[2019-06-06T21:38:17.597Z]	<dmitriz>	ok but why not use query params?
[2019-06-06T21:38:40.906Z]	<dmitriz>	be like, did=did:example:whatever&key-type=RSA&...
[2019-06-06T21:38:49.984Z]	<dmitriz>	like, that's exactly what url query params are for
[2019-06-06T21:38:52.619Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:39:03.273Z]	<drummond>	ack mtfk_robert
[2019-06-06T21:40:12.263Z]	<drummond>	jonathan: the use case would be that if you have a key type for a specific curve, then you can do a handshake of a specific type.
[2019-06-06T21:40:15.598Z]	<drummond>	q?
[2019-06-06T21:40:24.319Z]	<dmitriz>	jonathan: why not use query params for that?
[2019-06-06T21:40:31.210Z]	<dmitriz>	why use matrix?
[2019-06-06T21:41:01.680Z]	<dmitriz>	because there definitely is a linear explosion here. are we gonna reserve a <whatever>-type matrix parameter for every type of anything?
[2019-06-06T21:41:05.163Z]	<dmitriz>	like, that doesn't make sense...

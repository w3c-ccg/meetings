Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: We're good to go.
Will Abramson:  Okay hi welcome everyone uh Welcome to our first 
  CCT call of the new year happy New Year hope everyone had a 
  hopefully relaxing break.
Will Abramson:  Uh today we have young Kristoff here who is going 
  to present some dif work on it trades.
Will Abramson:  Uh before I get into that I'm just going to 
  review the typical ccg admin stuff so uh code of conduct code of 
  ethics and professional conduct reminder um you know we have a 
  code of conduct and ethics you know please treat everyone with 
  respect the friendly constructive and collaborative we want to 
  make sure everyone feels welcome to participate in these calls 
  and on the mailing list I think we do a good job of this but 
  let's you know continue let's start the new year with that in 
  mind um.
Will Abramson:  Next to have the IP notes so anybody is welcome 
  to participate in these calls we.
Will Abramson:  We're glad to have you participate however if you 
  want to contribute to ccg work items.
Will Abramson:  Uh you must be a member of the CCT with full IPR 
  agreement signed.
Will Abramson:  And if you don't know what that means or what 
  that is reach out to 1 of the chairs and we can help you with 
  that.
Will Abramson:  Just do that.
Will Abramson:  Uh next on the call now so this this calls are 
  recorded jitsi and transcribes through a.
Will Abramson:  Digital transcriber which isn't always the best 
  but we try our best uh and they will be made available after the 
  call.
Will Abramson:  If you want a queue you can raise your hand in 
  jitsi or you can type Q Plus into the chat on the left hand side.
Will Abramson:  And we will manage the queue as we go.
Will Abramson:  Okay I think that's everything I guess 
  introductions and reintroductions does anybody want to say hello 
  to the community uh the start of the new year has anyone new to 
  these calls and wants to introduce themselves please feel free to 
  jump on the Queue now.
Will Abramson:  Okay going going numb.
Will Abramson:  Uh okay next announcements and reminders does 
  anyone have any announcements or reminders for the community in 
  Greg.
Greg Bernstein:  Hi I wanted to let folks know that we've been 
  successful in advancing um.
Greg Bernstein:  Some of our BBS work our Advanced features over 
  at the ietf blind BBS and pseudonyms have a been adopted as 
  working group documents.
Greg Bernstein:  Is that some of our extra features 1 that we 
  call Anonymous holder bindings is enabled by by blind BBS and 
  that feature is like.
Greg Bernstein:  It helps the holder out with like another factor 
  of authentication to keep somebody from stealing their 
  credentials and the other 1 that is enabled is what we call 
  pseudonyms which actually has benefits.
Greg Bernstein:  To be anonymous but not completely they can have 
  an identity with a particular verifier and that also helps the V 
  verifier so these are 2 very important features to go along with.
Greg Bernstein:  Credentials as provided by BBS this unlink so 
  great progress there and we're going to be updating those drafts 
  at the ietf CFR and incorporating that into.
Greg Bernstein:  Uh already started incorporating that into the 
  VC uh Dibbs uh crypto Suite.
Greg Bernstein:  Good news there.
Will Abramson:  Great thanks Greg yeah that is good news.
Kaliya Young: https://didunconf.africa/
Kaliya Young:  Hey there um we've got the did on conference 
  Africa coming up in Cape Town um February 18 to 20th so if you.
Kaliya Young:  Strokes in the region and want to let them know 
  about it um.
Kaliya Young:  It's going to be a good event.
Kaliya Young:  The European iiw inspired event is um.
Kaliya Young:   Having a kind.
Kaliya Young:  Kind of special event focused on ecosystem 
  building um it's only 2 days it's March.
Kaliya Young:  Fourth and fifth so you can fly in.
<kaliya_identity_woman> DICE Ecosystems
Kaliya Young:  Think morning Circle at 10 am and fly out the next 
  day um so you can find more about that there and we have Internet 
  identity Workshop number 40.
Kaliya Young:   You can believe.
Kaliya Young:  That old now uh coming up April.
<harrison_tang> 20 years!!
<kaliya_identity_woman> IIW 40
Kaliya Young:  Um 8 to 10 um and then I well and now it's 1 more 
  thing Johannes urns and I have been running the fetty Forum 
  virtually and we're gonna have our fifth fetty forum.
Kaliya Young:  Uh April 1 and 2 it's not um posted yet but we're 
  announcing it today.
Kaliya Young:  So all those are great events for the community 
  thanks for letting me share.
Will Abramson:  Great thanks Clare thanks for sharing.
Will Abramson:  Okay I don't see anyone else on the Queue uh I 
  guess we progressed on work items I don't have anything to update 
  on that front but does anyone I guess it's been the holidays I'm 
  chewing there's no updates but.
Will Abramson:  There are jump on with you please.
Will Abramson:  Yeah not seeing anyone okay top uh oh man.
Manu Sporny:  Sorry I I probably worth mentioning um we are 
  preparing to take multiple in in the verifiable credential 
  working group we're taking the uh we're preparing to take 
  multiple specifications to the proposed recommendation phase in 
  q1 of this year so proposed and recommendation is basically we 
  are done it is going up for a final vote uh with the w3c 
  membership um many well all of the major features have been done 
  for a while we've been getting implementations we are trying to 
  lock down every single test suite at this point uh we have sent 
  out our very last request for review uh horizontal review across 
  all the groups privacy internationalization security all that 
  kind of stuff um and once they give us uh the go-ahead um which 
  again shouldn't take very long because they've all reviewed this 
  stuff before it's just that you know the Delta on the specs.
Manu Sporny:  Once they give us the the green light uh I expect 
  all of those specifications There's 7 of them um would be moved 
  to uh the vote to become a global standard um.
Manu Sporny:  Uh of course these dead you know these these 
  timelines can shift based because we're totally dependent on 
  outside parties to do review uh so we know how how that goes 
  sometimes um.
<jan_christoph_ebersbach_(identinet)> How does it work? Has the 
  meeting started, already?
Manu Sporny:  Good news that's a long you know 2 year slog uh 
  nearing its end um uh once we get those specifications out there 
  as Global standards uh you probably you know would would expect 
  that we are going to recharter the working group to add uh other 
  features we did not get to uh in this iteration so uh that's it 
  uh for a kind of just a heads up to expect um for the global 
  standards in q1 of this that's it.
Will Abramson:  Thanks man thanks for the update uh okay uh so 
  with that young Crystal I saw your message and I guess to me kind 
  of started but that's just the um.
Will Abramson:  I don't know the the pre the intro now we'll hand 
  over to you if you're I mean you're on the call I haven't heard 
  you speak yet but hand over to you to talk about good traits.
Will Abramson:  Can you hear us maybe you can't hear us.
<harrison_tang> @Jan You are on mute
Will Abramson:  And I see y'all muted in jitsi.
Will Abramson:  And Kristoff can you can you put in the chat at 
  least if you can't hear anything.
Harrison_Tang: Let me pin him over email but we can get to other 
  items if there are other items.
Will Abramson:  Yes I don't have a writing.
Will Abramson:  See you come off mute now young Crystal.
Will Abramson:  I still can't hear you.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  If you're on a browser other than Chrome it 
  probably will not work I've had a lot of issues with Firefox Etc 
  so maybe uh it could be a browser issue.
<greg_bernstein> Brave works. I use it for these calls.
Will Abramson:  Yes we should have tested this before.
<jan_christoph_ebersbach_(identinet)> Can you hear me?
<manu_sporny> You are muted. You have to unmute
Will Abramson:  Yeah I'm not seeing Otto the other person on the 
  specs.
Will Abramson:  Yeah we we.
Will Abramson:  Can't hear you.
Will Abramson:  I see you keep coming off and on mute but.
Will Abramson:  Maybe you don't have the right mic so.
Will Abramson:  Oh just about this everyone we should have 
  figured out the tech before.
Will Abramson:  Um I'm not sure what to propose here so I have a 
  suggestion I mean.
<jan_christoph_ebersbach_(identinet)> I am unmuted
Will Abramson:  Because if the meeting does anyone have anything 
  else that we could.
Will Abramson:   On the.
Will Abramson:  Right I don't have anything off the top of my 
  head.
<harrison_tang> yup, we cannot hear you.  you might want to 
  restart your browser and use Chrome
Manu Sporny:  I'm wondering if there's anybody else in the in the 
  did traits group that could maybe fill in while.
Manu Sporny:  On fixes his audio issues.
Will Abramson:  Yes I was looking for also but I think.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Okay now I can hear you oh 
  that's.
Will Abramson:  Oh now we can hear you.
Manu Sporny:  There we go we can hear you.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet):  I'm sorry.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Sorry I was a bit confused 
  apparently Firefox doesn't work with.
Will Abramson:  Yes apologies we should have told you that.
Will Abramson:  Oh fantastic yeah thanks for coming on sorry 
  about that confusion technical difficulties but yeah if you want 
  to share your screen or if you're just going to talk whatever's 
  best over to you I did traits.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Very good I'll quickly share 
  my screen.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Now let's go here okay let's 
  get.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): No you should be able to.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): See my screen.
Will Abramson:  Yeah I can see it.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Awesome great uh first of 
  all happy New Year and uh thank you for having me.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um I'll be talking about uh 
  DF did trades and um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh my name is Yan Chris of 
  abrasa or short JC I work for identity at a company based in 
  Breman Germany and I'm uh the editor of the uh did uh trade 
  specification at the decentralized identity Foundation.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): So quick background to uh 
  What uh.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Mean by did trades um did 
  trades is a specification that provides a framework for 
  describing G methods uh based on their operational and uh 
  functional characteristics.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um a little bit of 
  background what actually brought me uh to the specification um I 
  attended IBEW 39 back in April and uh back then the did TDW uh 
  did method was uh introduced uh by Stephen Curran and.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): I was wondering uh about how 
  did uh TDW is different from other did methods or um Carry as 
  another identity system in particular um and uh where it's 
  actually similar and um I found it very difficult to um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh to find a good 
  explanation of what the differences are uh between did methods 
  um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): When we look at the uh G 
  core specification it lists uh certain functionalities like 
  creation deletion um modification of did documents um but uh 
  we've seen.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh a lot of um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Being created around the IDS 
  for instance self-served certifying identifiers um that describe 
  themselves like uh with did key or now with DTW and um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh many other 
  characteristics and there wasn't really um a system and and a 
  vocabulary to express these uh differences and.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um this is how I uh 
  introduced um the idea of the ID trades um to the identity and 
  identifi identifiers and Discovery working group at uh dif.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And we uh started working um 
  in this working group and also aligned with uh other 
  organizations like uh the open Wallet foundation and also just 
  over IP Foundation um and we saw um interests from from many 
  sites that um such a thing as trades is being specified.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah we uh particularly I uh 
  we we see that there are many did methods nowadays I think over 
  190 uh GID Methods at the moment um and it's very difficult for 
  to assess how these diid methods are actually different uh from 1 
  another and this is what we try to um Express uh and capture with 
  the did traits uh effort.
Will Abramson:  Can I just uh jump in uh I see this bill is on 
  the Queue I don't know if you want to take questions as you go or 
  just wait till the end of what you up to you.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Oh yeah please feel free to 
  to ask questions uh in between uh I think we will have enough 
  time um to answer them right away um the the presentation is not 
  too long and please go forward yeah.
Will Abramson:   No worries.
Phil Long:  Sorry that was an inadvertent keystroke I just took 
  myself off.
Will Abramson:  Okay sorry about that yeah.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah the objective of did 
  trades is to create a common vocabulary for describing did 
  methods.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And uh to Foster 
  transparency uh for did method selection um that was actually my 
  initial.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um idea of me implementing 
  uh or using did methods um how do I find the right did method for 
  my particular use case and um to really simplify this uh 
  decision-making process.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): There are 2 key features um 
  that we are trying to deliver with this specification 1 is a list 
  of uh trades uh with clear descriptions.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And um sample descriptions 
  of did methods um that um that um feature these trades um and we 
  uh actually want to display them in in a easily consumable manner 
  we will look at the specification in a second actually I can post 
  the link here in the chat.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Everyone to look at let me 
  quickly bring up the chat and.
https://identity.foundation/did-traits/
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The link to the 
  specification is here okay.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The trades list um is um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Li expressed as uh a Json 
  schema.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And uh this schema is uh 
  very simple uh it um is just a long list of Trades that are 
  expressed as uh Boolean values.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um we have no uh 
  subcategorization of Trades so for instance um we could uh 
  thought about this as maybe we want to address certain traits 
  that I have to do with the modification of documents and um maybe 
  security um relevant traits but we decided to go for a very 
  simple straightforward list of Trades.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um and here are some example 
  trades um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The uh did is for instance 
  updatable or deactivated um or the IDS are self-certifying uh 
  these are some uh examples of the ID trades and we will go 
  through uh the the trades list in a second and also look at an 
  example of um how this would look like for a particular D method.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The uh did methods um for 
  instance the web or did key uh we would like to have descriptions 
  of the trades for each G method and um these descriptions should 
  ideally Leverage The schema that uh we created in the 
  specification.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet):  so that.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The ID method a descriptions 
  become machine readable.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And can be consumed by uh 
  various systems that either generate user facing information um 
  or even um use it for machine readable purposes.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um let us quickly jump over 
  to the specification um I think it will be.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Clearer in a second of how 
  it how it actually works.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The um specification is 
  still in in early version uh we are planning to release this um 
  work to present um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Ification to the working 
  group um very soon and now I'm presenting it here uh we're 
  looking uh for feedback on the specification and on the 
  especially on the list of Trades which is the most important part 
  of this specification.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): If you uh scroll down here 
  um you will see uh the definition of our trades list of our 
  trades.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh each individual trade is 
  listed here with um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh and a description um if 
  applicable there is also a link to um other specifications.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And we have here um in the 
  beginning uh trades that are uh related to the modifiability of 
  the did or the did document um so updatable deactivation uh in 
  particular we track with our service endpoints can be managed um 
  as we um found this to be relevant for implementers uh to know 
  whether they can.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Service endpoints or not uh 
  to their to did the ideas of this particular method um and 
  whether they did method is did is deletable.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um we also included.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet):  uh trans.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Actional fees um that could 
  apply for modification the modification of the ID documents.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): This is uh in particular um 
  relevant for Ledger based did methods.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And um now we come here to 
  more uh security relevant uh trades um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Again that there is no 
  subcategory but obviously we we had something like this in mind 
  when we uh went um through the list of Trades and created them um 
  so we have here self-certifying um as a trade that a did method 
  can provide um rotatable verification methods um pre- rotation of 
  keys rather new uh feature that was introduced by Carrie and um 
  is was also adopted by did TDW.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh multi signature 
  verification uh when updating the did document uh was added here.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): We have the trade uh human 
  readability of the did.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): So uh a feature like a 
  numeric of the dids that were created for this method the idea is 
  um if uh a blockchain based did method for instance is used it 
  all the existing identifiers could could be enumerated and known 
  um from the outside and uh that uh seem to be relevant um for um 
  the people who contributed to our specification.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um we distinguish between 
  locally resolvable uh just within uh the context of a transaction 
  um as.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Locally resolvable t uh 
  documents um this applies to for instance did Pierre or globally 
  resolvable uh did documents like uh did key or did web.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh we also included a trade 
  for the ID document history.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And also cryptographically 
  signed uh did document history um as an additional feature uh to 
  this particular trade.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um then we looked at uh 
  hosting of the ID documents uh where are they hosted either um no 
  hosting required for instance did key or did Pierre or documents 
  are centrally or decently hosted um on systems.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And the uh remaining did 
  trades um concern um cryptographic features of the ID methods um 
  this is not the latest um state of our discussion just before 
  this call we had another uh alignment and concluded that we 
  actually want to list.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Individual key type or key 
  um curve that could be.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Supported by a team did 
  method and um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Make each of these things 
  explicitly um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): A trade um at the moment uh 
  you see here that we uh went for.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The standards bodies um like 
  nist in the United States um and many others around the world who 
  uh approved certain cryptographic methods um but we uh found that 
  it is um a bit too tricky and too cumbersome to keep uh such a 
  list or such a trades list up-to-date across all uh the did 
  methods that will Implement um the or Define did traits.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And we would rather keep it 
  uh really Technical and focus with our trades on um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Technical aspects of a did 
  method um that are then um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Turned in in a higher 
  abstraction level um to for instance uh.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And compliance information 
  that um becomes relevant for a certain entity who wants to use a 
  did method or not use a did method.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yes this is uh the list of 
  uh did trades that we identified.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um I would say maybe we.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Put uh questions a bit on 
  the back burner and uh go into an example of how this could look 
  like in an um in a description.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet):  of a.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Concrete the ID method um 
  and then I'm happy to take questions and suggestions of how we 
  can advance the specification and also um how this could become 
  uh relevant for you and maybe uh to others as well.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Specific the these uh trades 
  here are specified as uh adjacent schema when you open this URL 
  here.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): He will um find the 
  underlying Json schema.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): With uh each trade having a 
  unique name here and type and title and description.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And we leveraged this 
  schema.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Example descriptions that we 
  created here um so this is an example for the did key the ID 
  method.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh we follow here uh the did 
  core specification according to uh What uh characters are allowed 
  here for name um and.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): You can just reference the 
  schema here and then.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Are able to create um this 
  definition and you see here each of these um values is expressed 
  as uh Boolean value.
<dmitri_zagidulin> I'm fairly sure US Gov uses did:key..
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): If support is there for 
  instance here for dead key it is a globally resolvable uh did 
  method um then he would just place.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Here and um claim support 
  for this particular trade.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): That we that did method 
  authors would.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Create this trade definition 
  on their own.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): If a trade is not listed 
  here for instance if a new trade is added or if the author.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Doesn't list it then it is 
  assumed that the value is false so that the trade is not uh 
  supported by the D method.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): With this uh description.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): We autogenerated this um 
  table as an example uh for for did methods.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And hope that uh 
  implementers are able to uh then use this to figure out quickly.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): How their requirements apply 
  to certain did methods and um filter down the list of the ID 
  methods that are relevant to them um to further dive down into 
  the details of the did method.
<dmitri_zagidulin> Eeeeverything is human readable, if you have 
  enough patience :)
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): The specification um or the 
  list of Trades does not try to capture every single unique aspect 
  of a did method uh we try to.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Here is the FediForum I mentioned it at 
  the beginning of the call
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): To keep it at a level where 
  um trades are uh implementable is implementable by different did 
  methods and it's not just super unique to 1 particular did method 
  um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah so that they can be 
  compared and that they still stay relevant uh for implementers.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah I still in um at a 
  relatively early stage of this uh specification the specification 
  was started in I think July August um around about that time and 
  uh are we are now in the stage of presenting this to uh our 
  working group um which uh still leaves uh time to to modify and 
  update the specification um before we want to publish um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): So if you have any uh 
  suggestions um for trades uh please feel free to to make them and 
  um I'm happy to uh receive your questions and feedback.
Will Abramson:  Great thank you uh I see em on the Queue so go 
  ahead.
Manu Sporny:  Sure um hey and Kristoff this is a wonderful work 
  so thank you very much for putting in the time to um organized 
  you know all the different traits and uh provide a way for people 
  to express them like analyze and express Stitt traits I think 
  this is super useful work so thank you for that um I guess the 
  the question is more around integrating this with the did 
  extensions registry so as you know we have this sprawling 
  registry of you know over as you said over 190 we might have hit 
  more than 200 now did methods um and it feels like it would be 
  very useful for uh people that registered their did methods to 
  also be able to specify the did traits that the did method 
  they're registering has um ha have you um discussed this uh in 
  the group um are you interested in uh you know.
Manu Sporny:  Adding this schema to the did extension 
  registration schema do you feel like it would be helpful to do 
  that um just general questions in that in that area um interested 
  in your thoughts.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yes uh we have not uh 
  discussed this in detail but um Marcus sodello mentioned it and I 
  think it would be a great addition um um to the registry uh we're 
  currently actually linking here to the registry already um so if 
  this could become part of it um I um I would be very happy I 
  think it would make uh the schema way more uh.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Relevant and usable by 
  implementers and also by Method authors.
Will Abramson:  If his follow-up manager go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  It I can go after Ted I I do have.
Will Abramson:  Okay sure that.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Yeah um this 
  seems very much in uh parallel to the did rubric um but it seems 
  that it was developed without knowing of the rubric existed 
  because they started off by saying well there's there's no way to 
  compare these methods except that's exactly what the rubric was 
  in to do so just uh food for thought if nothing else through the 
  link in a above in the chat.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yes uh thank you so much uh 
  we did know about the uh the rubric before actually I uh.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Mentioned it but uh we 
  listed here um additional work that was done um in particular 
  with the rubric um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): We found that the focus is.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Kind of wide in certain 
  areas um and it's.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): It becomes very difficult 
  for our did method to express.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Support for a certain uh 
  feature um or a certain aspect uh of the rubric and uh we found 
  that.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): I'm having a simple list 
  that consists just of Boolean values.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Makes uh makes it a bit 
  easier um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And also maybe captures 
  additional aspects for instance security related aspects like um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Certifying identifiers um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): That aren't currently not 
  addressed by the Rubik um my understanding is that the main 
  objective of the rubric was to address decentralization of dids 
  and also uh privacy.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): But please correct me if I'm 
  wrong.
Will Abramson:  Chad do you have any more on that tomorrow.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Um well the 
  rubric was intended to.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): A framework 
  for.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Who wanted to 
  use dits in some way to compare the did methods and figure out 
  which ones 1 or ones uh were best suited to their use.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Certainly 
  most of its uh.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Descriptive 
  factors are um subjective and.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): More range 
  than than Boolean but adding booleans to it is entirely doable 
  and I think makes a lot of sense.
Will Abramson:  Yeah I mean I'll just add that I do think that 
  yeah it'll be interesting to see what like how these 2 work 
  streams could come together or like where they overlap could 
  usefully complement each other.
Will Abramson:  How may I help you.
Manu Sporny:  Um right yeah I I agree with that um statement um 
  well and uh you know I I view the the rubric more as kind of a as 
  as Ted mentioned um you know it's it's um you know there's their 
  objective measurements and then there are kind of you know um 
  hard measurements you know that you can made on make on a dead 
  method so the thing that I really like about the did trade stuff 
  is like it's a very simple like yes no answer right um whereas 
  the rubric has more wide ranging questions around you know like 
  how decentralized is the dead method or um uh those sorts of 
  questions so I do agree that you know potentially the work could 
  come together in the future but you know I see the did traits 
  work um you know having value a just by itself um uh the the 
  thing I put myself on the queue for um so uh.
Manu Sporny:  Young Kristoff I think it it's it's great to hear 
  that you think there's value in you know uh using this to to um 
  make the data extensions registered better um I I I agree with 
  that as well I'm and I and I wanted to kind of figure out a way 
  to make that happen sooner than later so the did extensions you 
  know we have an active did working group at world at w3c we're 
  able to make significant changes to the data extension's uh uh at 
  any point in the next like year and a half um and uh like for 
  example you could go in tomorrow and raise a pull request on the 
  registration criteria for did extensions and say hey it would be 
  nice if optionally people could list the did traits um uh and and 
  we could we could change the registry within weeks right to to do 
  that uh I would certainly be in support of that uh even if it's 
  not.
Manu Sporny:   You know.
Manu Sporny:  Complete so so like you know things like updatable 
  and deactivate things to put in there but as you mentioned uh 
  earlier the whole you know discussion around cryptography and 
  whether or not we specify the curves or specify the countries 
  that's still under discussion so maybe we don't have those uh uh 
  just yet um so I just wanted to kind of um.
Manu Sporny:  You or support you in uh doing that change sooner 
  than later uh because I do think it would be useful to have some 
  traits um listed um the the big problem of course is like we have 
  you know 2 almost 200 maybe over 200 did methods now where we 
  don't have those traits so we'd have to make it optional and we'd 
  have to try and make sure that the registrants uh went in and 
  categorized it we can't you know expect the maintainers to go and 
  recategorization.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just 1.
Manu Sporny:  Wanted to support you in doing that if you uh were 
  thinking of doing that anytime soon that's it.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Great thank you yes I'm uh 
  completely new to this uh.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): About this work and I very 
  much appreciate uh your support in this um yeah I'm happy to to 
  open an issue I think we will.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): I think we will um apply the 
  last changes that we agreed upon um in the in the working group 
  and I think then um I I can uh raise the issue and um then 
  continue the work with you to integrate uh the schema into the 
  the registration did extensions.
Will Abramson:  Thanks I'll just have to I think that is a good 
  idea I guess I'm a little hesitant in that um.
Will Abramson:  Who whose responsibility is to check those traits 
  are an accurate representation of the did methods.
Will Abramson:  Sales owners on the on the people.
Will Abramson:  Anyway we can figure that out I think raising a 
  PR is a great Next Step uh I think I saw someone on the queue.
Will Abramson:  Uh Ted you still on the game.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Uh no I 
  should be asking you.
Will Abramson:  Did I say that right coyote.
Kayode Ezike:  About that like some reason why I was acting up 
  but I had a first of all thank you you know the presentation this 
  is a great presentation as I was listening 1 thing that came to 
  mind was.
Kayode Ezike:  That there's not really a way to ensure that 
  whatever the registrations people are you know making on the due 
  traits that that are in the repository that they they actually 
  does comply with it I wonder if useful if uh test Suite could be 
  integrated in some way it might be tricky because you know.
Kayode Ezike:  That would require you know just 1 implementation 
  which 1 do you choose to actually you know prove that I think 
  that could be discussed but I'm wondering um is if that's 
  something that y'all have thought about is a way to um alongside 
  of the check marks that you were showing for every did um or 
  rather under uh underneath that is a verification against a suite 
  that yes it does actually have this trade or comply with this 
  trade has that come up in discussions at all.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah yes it has come up.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Not sure whether we have an 
  open issue.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): I don't think so um it has 
  come up and ideally it would be um testable in an automated 
  manner um I fully agree with you we have not uh put much effort 
  into it um as we see our main deliverable to be the list of 
  Trades.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): And um additional aspects 
  like um how to test uh support for trades um has been um kind of 
  put on the back burner same with the um comparison table here 
  it's just an example uh that we generated to help uh create a 
  better understanding of uh the usefulness or 1 of 1 application 
  of uh trades um however we haven't um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah I don't have the plan 
  to create.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Such a description for every 
  single did method so um we want to leave this up to the authors 
  and um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um we're happy to discuss 
  how uh these trades could be maybe tested in an automated manner 
  I think some of them are more testable than others um so I think 
  once modifiability.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Becomes testable then I 
  think a good portion of the trades can be verified um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): However yeah what do we have 
  here um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yeah hosting assessing how a 
  did method is hosted.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Is not not super super 
  simple because it requires the an understanding of the underlying 
  system um so I think.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): There are degrees of how 
  well a trade can be tested um and we didn't want to limit 
  ourselves to just Trace that can be tested in automated Banner we 
  came from the other perspective of saying what is relevant for 
  implementers to know about the did method.
<kayode_ezike> Yep, all makes sense Jan. Thanks!
Will Abramson:  Great thanks John uh Manu.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I think that's a a a good good statement I I I 
  think I'd argue the the other way meaning um.
Manu Sporny:   I don't.
Manu Sporny:  No well I think it's okay for people that register 
  did methods to make mistake or lie in their registration um 
  speaking is 1 of the main containers the maintainers are never 
  going to be able to do with hero vetting of every single trait um 
  uh and it works against an individual to say that their did 
  method supports a trait when it doesn't right at at some point 
  someone's going to find out and they will raise an issue or 
  report it or say that this is incorrect and um uh and then you 
  know the maintainers can modify it and update it to to you know 
  make the change at that point so I think that that will require 
  less effort on the maintainers behalf than having to vet 
  everything like we don't have enough we don't have enough 
  bandwidth to vet every single thing that's that's stated in these 
  registrations so uh so I I think it's okay to just you know have 
  a list and use the schema and whoever registers it can say 
  anything.
Manu Sporny:   That they want to just.
Manu Sporny:  Like they can.
Manu Sporny:  They want to in their did method um uh and just 
  leave it at that the other thing that I would maybe argue against 
  is doing a test Suite uh I I I totally get where uh Cody you're 
  you're coming from I I think it um G given enough time and 
  resources uh meaning like our our time the community's time.
Manu Sporny:   I think.
Kayode Ezike: +1 Manu
Manu Sporny:  Having you know testable traits would be great um 
  uh however I think we're working with like you know all of us are 
  working with like limited time we only have so much time to do 
  certain things and there may be other things that the community 
  could put their focus on um rather than you know testing uh the 
  these uh these traits because I think eventually the the whether 
  or not you had the trade or not comes out like if for any popular 
  you know did method if it's you know not accurate uh implementers 
  will uh uh say something uh you know about it and it'll it'll be 
  corrected in time so I think it's okay for us to just start with 
  kind of a a more lacks approach um better to have you know the 
  registrants just claim what their tra are and be able to sort or 
  pick based on them then not have the information at all or wait 
  for you know a perfect solution where a a good enough solution 
  might might uh work in the short term.
Manu Sporny:   That's it.
Will Abramson:  Thanks honey make a good point now.
Will Abramson:  That's a yeah I would yeah I would encourage you 
  to create a PR.
Will Abramson:  We go from there okay great.
Will Abramson:  Okay I don't think there's anyone on the queue.
Will Abramson:  Anybody else have any final comments Sean do you 
  have any.
Will Abramson:  I have 1 question for you quite simple how does 
  people in on this call get involved in this work like is there a 
  regular call time is there.
Will Abramson:  Where where do we go participate.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Yes um so you could either 
  get involved by um raising issues on GitHub um the link is up 
  here in the specification.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Um also we have um a call I 
  think once a week uh sorry once uh once a month um I think it's 
  the.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): First Tuesday of the month 
  it should be I guess yeah um first or second Tuesday of the month 
  so today was what's the call so let me quickly check so first 
  Tuesday of the month is our call and um you're happy uh you you 
  can join um.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet):  if you are.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Uh a dif member um you 
  should receive notifications in the um identifiers and Discovery 
  working group Channel.
Will Abramson:  Any final questions.
Jan_Christoph_Ebersbach_(identinet): Then I will say thank you 
  for having me and uh thank you for uh encouraging me to create 
  this uh PR I'll happily do it and I'm looking forward to Future 
  collaboration.
Will Abramson:  Great my question thanks a lot yeah.
Will Abramson:  Okay great thanks a lot everyone.
Mahmoud Alkhraishi:  Oh no sorry I just want to say thanks.
<harrison_tang> Happy New Year, everyone!
Will Abramson:  Okay great yeah we can give you back some time uh 
  have a great rest of your week and see you next week thanks for.

<phil_barker> In case anyone who is interested missed it, UK Gov 
  has announced it is introducing digital credentials, with a 
  GOV.UK Wallet and App.  Driving License and various benefit 
  entitlements are the first target credentials, See 
  https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-driving-licence-coming-this-year
<phillip_long> The UK Gov also rejected using proprietary wallets
<kaliya_identity_woman> i don't
<dmitri_zagidulin> np
<jeff_o_-_humanos> It has been a treat to be alongside all the 
  great efforts here & at IIW over the last 7 years I've been 
  around! I'll see you there!
<phillip_long> From the Guardian re: UK digital mDLs and other 
  creds:
<phillip_long> In the Though Shrapnel post about this they wrote: 
  "UK government is preparing to bring in a dedicated app, 
  initially for digital driving licenses â€” as is happening 
  elsewhere in the world â€” but eventually for everything from tax 
  payment to benefit claims and reminding people what their 
  National Insurance number is."
<kayode_ezike> a+
<phillip_long> Kayode didn't Golda already talk to you about the 
  Wyoming project?
<kayode_ezike> Haha, yes didnâ€™t know if I had the license to 
  reveal that ðŸ˜…
<phillip_long> Also from Thought Shrapnel "This is a fascinating 
  area for me, for a couple of reasons. First, the technology 
  mentioned ("allowing users to hide their addresses in certain 
  situations") make me think this is very likely to be based on the 
  Verifiable Credentials standard"
<phillip_long> FYI Thought Shrapnel is Doug Belshawâ€™s blog.
<phillip_long> Sounds like WAS to me ; -)
<dmitri_zagidulin> definitely haha
<phillip_long> Selecting the OpenID Federation specification for 
  the DCC and Credential Engine Issuer Registry Project 
  -https://blog.dcconsortium.org/selecting-the-openid-federation-specification-for-the-dcc-and-credential-engine-issuer-registry-f9079f620472
<phillip_long> Anolther approach (more global in perspective from 
  Ayra Forum nee GAN): 
  https://ayra.forum/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Introduction-to-Ayra-V3.pdf
<phillip_long> A principle of the VC data model and 
  decentralization is that verification does not depend on 
  contacting the issuer.
<phillip_long> That meta-registry approach is one Ayra Forum is 
  pursuing
<kayode_ezike> Haha, been planning a render method for doing that 
  rendering of CLRs
<kayode_ezike> Sorry, not a new method, but using an existing one 
  to do it
<phillip_long> Another method that Joe Andrieu  has shared is 
  Selective Redaction. It  is different from Selective Disclosure. 
  The former is to remove selected fields in a VC, whereas the 
  latter is to derive a new Verifiable Presentation (VP) containing 
  only the fields chosen for disclosure. Selective Redaction has 
  the primary purpose of obfuscating selected fields in a VC, while 
  still linking the VC to the original issuer.
<mahesh_balan_-_pocketcred.com> I have another call, see you all 
  next week!
Robert Long:

<phillip_long> As long as it is flagged that selective disclosure 
  has been applied to the credential sent.
<phillip_long> I think is still the case @TallTEd
<phil_barker> I need to drop. See you all later.

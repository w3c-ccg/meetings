[2025-01-27T16:11:59.337Z]	<Phil_Barker>	In case anyone who is interested missed it, UK Gov has announced it is introducing digital credentials, with a GOV.UK Wallet and App.  Driving License and various benefit entitlements are the first target credentials, See https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-driving-licence-coming-this-year

[2025-01-27T16:17:54.220Z]	<Phillip_Long>	In the Though Shrapnel post about this they wrote: "UK government is preparing to bring in a dedicated app, initially for digital driving licenses â€” as is happening elsewhere in the world â€” but eventually for everything from tax payment to benefit claims and reminding people what their National Insurance number is."

[2025-01-27T16:21:41.665Z]	<Phillip_Long>	Also from Thought Shrapnel "This is a fascinating area for me, for a couple of reasons. First, the technology mentioned ("allowing users to hide their addresses in certain situations") make me think this is very likely to be based on the Verifiable Credentials standard"
[2025-01-27T16:22:36.176Z]	<Phillip_Long>	FYI Thought Shrapnel is Doug Belshawâ€™s blog.

[2025-01-27T16:33:22.469Z]	<Phillip_Long>	A principle of the VC data model and decentralization is that verification does not depend on contacting the issuer.

[2025-01-27T16:38:55.282Z]	<Phillip_Long>	That meta-registry approach is one Ayra Forum is pursuing
[2025-01-27T16:42:56.315Z]	<Kayode_Ezike>	Haha, been planning a render method for doing that rendering of CLRs
[2025-01-27T16:43:25.329Z]	<Kayode_Ezike>	Sorry, not a new method, but using an existing one to do it
[2025-01-27T16:46:15.127Z]	<Phillip_Long>	Another method that Joe Andrieu  has shared is Selective Redaction. It  is different from Selective Disclosure. The former is to remove selected fields in a VC, whereas the latter is to derive a new Verifiable Presentation (VP) containing only the fields chosen for disclosure. Selective Redaction has the primary purpose of obfuscating selected fields in a VC, while still linking the VC to the original issuer.

[2025-01-27T16:48:50.254Z]	<Phillip_Long>	As long as it is flagged that selective disclosure has been applied to the credential sent.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-175').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-175').show()" id="175" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You have to kind of identify that click I mean that&apos;s and the clicks kind of identified through a public key but but then how does the verifier know whether or not to trust that click my my presumption here is that you&apos;d put it in something like the did document you would just list it as another key that can make assertions in your did document and the verifier somehow uh finds out that you know oh you are you know presenting this or or they they figure out a way to find you know that key publication in a did document that they trust and then that&apos;s the thing that gives them kind of trust in the issuing click right they they have to kind of do some kind of Discovery process to figure out who if if 1 of the issues issuers they trust is a part of a clique that ended up um. <a id="link-175" style="display:none;" href="#175">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-176').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-176').show()" id="176" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Issuing the the credential so do you have um what are your what are your thoughts on oh sorry that was 1 of the things so I I it feels like there&apos;s an explosion in public Keys when we need to put them somewhere like in a did document the other difficult thing as you know Christopher is like getting some variation of this through the ietf crypto form research group can take years um but this feels like. <a id="link-176" style="display:none;" href="#176">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-177').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-177').show()" id="177" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You know doable like I mean it if we started today I would imagine we&apos;d be able to get this done in like 2 years um. <a id="link-177" style="display:none;" href="#177">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-178').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-178').show()" id="178" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So so what are your thoughts on kind of the standardization that would need to happen with some of this Frost stuff and then what are your thoughts on you know how does the verifier trust the issuing click. <a id="link-178" style="display:none;" href="#178">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-179').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-179').show()" id="179" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Right so I think it depends on things so I&apos;ll give you this example uh I I&apos;m sure are you seeing my shared screen. <a id="link-179" style="display:none;" href="#179">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-180').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-180').show()" id="180" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Okay so obviously this requires nothing but you know just simply saying here&apos;s you know ah you know seventh uh um uh you know signature Suite which supports say uh you know a bip 340 Shore or ristretto 255 ristretto or whatever um uh you and this is again 1 you cannot do with 25519 um but this actually here is an interesting thing because when I reviewed that this is a peer group. <a id="link-180" style="display:none;" href="#180">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-181').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-181').show()" id="181" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  I can simply do a a cryptographic finite field edition of this public key and this public key and it will equal this public key okay that&apos;s 1 of the things that schnoor offers is this finite uh field um uh aggregation capability so you know if you know who&apos;s what Christopher&apos;s public key is and what Wolf&apos;s public key is you uh then. <a id="link-181" style="display:none;" href="#181">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-182').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-182').show()" id="182" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  This fairly trivial operation uh to determine yes that they you know this would not be possible unless those 2 were were the same and so you might verify the signature uh that is you know using this thing here but this sort of allows for some additional information revealed and I think this is a uh you know this is a small example of a whole bunch of these kinds of problems because for instance um uh this is what I call an accountable uh signature in the sense that um because we&apos;re using Music 2 uh we can through a variety of mechanisms know definitively that Christopher was 1 of the parties that signed it meaning Christopher is accountable as 1 of the parties in this in this Quorum of 2 of 2 or if you&apos;re using Taproot there&apos;s some other techniques where you&apos;re combining these um and if you go to my last frost presentation uh from last Tuesday um on YouTube. <a id="link-182" style="display:none;" href="#182">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-183').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-183').show()" id="183" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:   You can see. <a id="link-183" style="display:none;" href="#183">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-184').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-184').show()" id="184" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  An example of it. <a id="link-184" style="display:none;" href="#184">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-185').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-185').show()" id="185" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  You can know but Frost is not an accountable protocol in fact um you know even though I have secret material I can&apos;t prove that I contributed to the signature. <a id="link-185" style="display:none;" href="#185">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-186').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-186').show()" id="186" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Um I a quorum of parties can prove can prove that I contributed or make a claim and prove that I contributed to the signature but it&apos;s what is known as a non-accountable signature so it turns out there&apos;s some interesting advantages for having non-accountable signatures that you know prevent certain kinds of coercion allows for certain kinds of voting and anonymity but sometimes you want parties to be accountable so how do you do both is kind of 1 of my big challenges you know uh this month the next month um and you know I&apos;ve begun to work on it in uh this uh research paper so and we&apos;ve you know barely begun um. <a id="link-186" style="display:none;" href="#186">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-188').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-188').show()" id="188" class="comment"><span class="name">Christopher Allen</span>:  Oh and 1 thing I was subtle in there because I hadn&apos;t really come up with it was in that 1 I&apos;d actually put that peer information in the in with the credential um but in fact it really should have been in the signature block um and because but it&apos;s something extra in the signature block that requires it or the proof block uh it&apos;s some other proof that if you need that if you really want you know to verify that it truly is a peer because there&apos;s because that&apos;s important for some reason or a click or 1 of these other forms uh you know which can be a proof of of Click formation you know you can do all these social you can do all these graph cryptographic graph things with it um you know so you the signature may not be all you need you also want in some cases to do this other stuff it really belongs in the signature block. <a id="link-188" style="display:none;" href="#188">✪</a></div>

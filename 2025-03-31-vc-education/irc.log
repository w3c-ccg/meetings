[2025-03-31T15:05:25.338Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh yeah so speaking of recording.
[2025-03-31T15:05:34.348Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the granches community group ccg have has recently um announced that we're um.
[2025-03-31T15:05:38.294Z]	<Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_🇨🇦>	..open.. 8->
[2025-03-31T15:05:42.866Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Transitioning to a different uh recording and transcription infrastructure.
[2025-03-31T15:05:53.394Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Short of it is uh we're going to try using Google Google meet uh with uh some open source AI transcription uh that's.
[2025-03-31T15:05:59.841Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Testing has been uh fairly dramatically better than the transcriber here so uh.
[2025-03-31T15:06:07.724Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We can look forward to hopefully better uh transcription and recording quality and um.
[2025-03-31T15:06:11.804Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Another familiar interface hopefully all of us have used Google meet.
[2025-03-31T15:06:15.719Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So we'll keep you uh we'll keep you posted on the progress there.
[2025-03-31T15:06:16.977Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	That's not very difficult, TBH :-)
[2025-03-31T15:06:18.211Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right uh.
[2025-03-31T15:06:24.775Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Let's uh yeah low bar uh low bar to Ico.
[2025-03-31T15:06:25.868Z]	<Simone_Ravaioli>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:06:30.225Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right so let's uh jump into our main topic uh which is.
[2025-03-31T15:06:35.813Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15RXxjlgNaLSxgXqceZvUmw52Dq6X4bx0H5Oi_WEwe7I
[2025-03-31T15:06:38.231Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Issuer and verify Registries 101 uh so here are the slides again in chat.
[2025-03-31T15:06:41.701Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And so I will share screen.
[2025-03-31T15:06:52.751Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And please feel free to ask questions as we go so uh click the raise hand icon or type Q Plus in GC chat and you'll get added to the queue.
[2025-03-31T15:06:59.197Z]	<Simone_Ravaioli>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:06:59.718Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We'll we'll have uh time for questions uh afterwards but it's all also helpful so that we don't forget.
[2025-03-31T15:07:02.787Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Um to ask.
[2025-03-31T15:07:09.978Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The questions as we go all right hopefully here we go.
[2025-03-31T15:07:16.453Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Can everybody see presentation mode.
[2025-03-31T15:07:24.183Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Fantastic all right so.
[2025-03-31T15:07:27.196Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's what we're going to talk about.
[2025-03-31T15:07:31.462Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's the tldr so to speak 1.
[2025-03-31T15:07:37.443Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I'm going to do anything with verifiable credentials for most cases most open world cases which I think.
[2025-03-31T15:07:41.416Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Most of us are here for in this task force to do.
[2025-03-31T15:07:43.423Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Going to need registries.
[2025-03-31T15:08:01.465Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And why is that we'll get into it uh but basically because cryptographic identifiers are opaque and we need to on opaque them all right we're gonna talk about how Registries work what goes into 1 going to mention uh a little some of the issues with registry governance.
[2025-03-31T15:08:10.529Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Talk about um some projects specifications and further resources that uh you can look into to find out more.
[2025-03-31T15:08:12.687Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  let's step.
[2025-03-31T15:08:18.531Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Back quick reminder uh because this is going to be important it's going to lead to why exactly we need.
[2025-03-31T15:08:23.011Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's a credential set of claims.
[2025-03-31T15:08:36.534Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's a claim uh just a statement think of them for in in crude technical terms they're going to be key value pairs they're going to be uh somebody said something okay.
[2025-03-31T15:08:53.046Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: As usual we've got a whole range of credentials from uh low value bare credentials that uh typically don't have bindings to to an identity such as you know a movie ticket or I don't know a lottery ticket or something.
[2025-03-31T15:09:00.525Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh that can be anonymous we we call those barrier credentials and then we have a whole world of.
[2025-03-31T15:09:14.046Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Find credentials that are bound to a particular identity such as passport diploma even play plane tickets uh they can be bound to a cryptographic identity meaning.
[2025-03-31T15:09:20.542Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This credential was issued to somebody that has a possession of this key.
[2025-03-31T15:09:23.030Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 to 345 or.
[2025-03-31T15:09:29.236Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This uh credential was issued specifically to Demetrius agodon okay and.
[2025-03-31T15:09:29.471Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  of course.
[2025-03-31T15:09:37.514Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh only a name is used we get into issues of uh duplicate names and how do you deduplicate.
[2025-03-31T15:09:39.533Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Don't get into that but.
[2025-03-31T15:09:45.519Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the hopefully the the idea is clear.
[2025-03-31T15:09:50.030Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So if credential is a set of claims what's a verifiable credentials.
[2025-03-31T15:10:04.237Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's machine readable document that has some claims has some metadata about the claims and has some sort of cryptographic proof typically a signature so.
[2025-03-31T15:10:16.010Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 more claims such as MIT claims or says that Alice has a PHD in public education.
[2025-03-31T15:10:26.100Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 or more um attributes about the credential itself such as this credential is only good until next year.
[2025-03-31T15:10:29.605Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Also this this credential was issued by MIT.
[2025-03-31T15:10:34.628Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then third has a digital signature.
[2025-03-31T15:10:56.686Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then that's going to be there's going to be the key Parts uh this is going to be key to understanding about why we need Registries in the first place because it's uh it's very easy when you first hear about verifiable credential to to hear about it and say oh okay hey the credentials are signed therefore we know exactly who signed it.
[2025-03-31T15:11:03.232Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What we do and we don't we know exactly the identity of the key that signed it.
[2025-03-31T15:11:15.393Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But nothing else about that for anything else nothing else beyond that like who that key belongs to uh is it authorized is it expired etc etc.
[2025-03-31T15:11:21.984Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: For any sort of useful real world information about.
[2025-03-31T15:11:28.494Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So so is does this key actually belong to MIT we need registries.
[2025-03-31T15:11:31.699Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	RE: credential definition, I would argue that from the 2 presented on your first slide, Dmitri, the first might be too restricted for some more complex credentials (e.g. joint degrees): “A credential is a set of one or more claims *made by the same entity*.”
[2025-03-31T15:11:34.471Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh again to uh sort of restate it uh.
[2025-03-31T15:11:36.482Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In different way.
[2025-03-31T15:11:38.483Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Have a credential.
[2025-03-31T15:11:38.813Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  often have.
[2025-03-31T15:11:46.995Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Identifiers that doesn't though it doesn't need to has a number of claims such as name and address and date of birth or.
[2025-03-31T15:11:49.281Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  date of.
[2025-03-31T15:11:54.971Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sub subject of study for the diploma and so on.
[2025-03-31T15:11:59.466Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's got uh a number of.
[2025-03-31T15:12:08.120Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Find um metadata Fields about the credential itself when was it issued when does it expire.
[2025-03-31T15:12:17.596Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What are the terms of service usage how do you render the credential in a in a browser or in a mobile phone all that kind of stuff.
[2025-03-31T15:12:20.586Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And of course the digital signature.
[2025-03-31T15:12:25.131Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's uh 1.
[2025-03-31T15:12:37.616Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Just 1 example of what that looks like in machine readable form so this is some Json again we've got the optional credential identifier we have a number of claims such as uh.
[2025-03-31T15:12:47.190Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The name of the person the university they're an alumni of uh got an example of um internationalization and localization.
[2025-03-31T15:12:51.099Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Which is a constant topic uh for us here in this group.
[2025-03-31T15:12:55.594Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We've got some metadata about the credential.
[2025-03-31T15:13:01.105Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Such as this is who he was issued by and here we start to see the problem.
[2025-03-31T15:13:06.785Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Got issuer key 1 to key 1 to 3 for 5 who is that.
[2025-03-31T15:13:09.718Z]	<Kayode_Ezike>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:13:13.761Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Like we we have we have strong cryptographic proof that the entity signing this.
[2025-03-31T15:13:17.739Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is definitely key 1 2 3 4 5.
[2025-03-31T15:13:19.768Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who does that keep belong to.
[2025-03-31T15:13:24.768Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And that's all we know about the signature uh.
[2025-03-31T15:13:36.781Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So to get back to why we need issue Registries we need them because cryptographic identifiers are opaque.
[2025-03-31T15:13:39.419Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  we need.
[2025-03-31T15:13:43.260Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To do something useful with them we need to unop them.
[2025-03-31T15:13:52.281Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: At the other end when you hand over the diploma to an admissions office to an employer's desk to uh.
[2025-03-31T15:13:54.758Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Random person checking on the street.
[2025-03-31T15:13:58.734Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They're going to run.
[2025-03-31T15:14:01.758Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Tribal credential through a verify function.
[2025-03-31T15:14:05.357Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Verify function can only tell them 2 things.
[2025-03-31T15:14:09.814Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is the signature valid yes or no.
[2025-03-31T15:14:14.817Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And what key identifier it was signed by.
[2025-03-31T15:14:14.967Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  that's it.
[2025-03-31T15:14:20.848Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So all of the all of the heavy lifting of um.
[2025-03-31T15:14:24.259Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who that key belongs to.
[2025-03-31T15:14:38.359Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Can't be done by the automatic verification code can't be done by the libraries that are just checking the digital signature we need to build additional infrastructure around it.
[2025-03-31T15:14:46.832Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh those of you who have who have been in uh identity case or or have been thinking about this uh for a while uh.
[2025-03-31T15:15:00.754Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You can probably say hey what about can we sign with websites right does it have to be opaque key identifiers does it have to be did key don't we at least have did web and similar mechanisms.
[2025-03-31T15:15:08.816Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Don't we have the for example the well-known mechanism for for websites can't we use that.
[2025-03-31T15:15:12.911Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yes of course we can uh.
[2025-03-31T15:15:15.798Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But as we all know from.
[2025-03-31T15:15:21.336Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: History of the web fishing uh and and just just using a browser.
[2025-03-31T15:15:31.346Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Knowing the website of an entity doesn't 100% translate to uh knowing exactly.
[2025-03-31T15:15:33.805Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Where that website came from.
[2025-03-31T15:15:39.834Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We we know that.
[2025-03-31T15:15:46.354Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Websites can be slightly misspelled can have uh.
[2025-03-31T15:15:55.894Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: International uh characters that look like different letters right so so basically you can fake websites or even if the website is not fake.
[2025-03-31T15:16:07.892Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Didn't look just looking at a website there's no automated and oftentimes there's no even uh human assisted way of knowing that.
[2025-03-31T15:16:14.361Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This is this is a legit entity that should be signing this credential in the first place.
[2025-03-31T15:16:22.863Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's uh 30 years of History.
[2025-03-31T15:16:29.354Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Of of the worldwide web and all of the problems from uh DNS and and certificate authorities.
[2025-03-31T15:16:35.910Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Can we do even slightly better with verifiable credentials can we have some of the problems.
[2025-03-31T15:16:38.365Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In order to do that.
[2025-03-31T15:16:44.441Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Need this infrastructure of issue of Registries we need to.
[2025-03-31T15:16:53.550Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Build in identity verification from the very start.
[2025-03-31T15:16:53.888Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  okay so what are.
[2025-03-31T15:17:04.897Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Having taking all of that detour through what's a verifiable credential uh and why we need Registries in the first place Registries are just directories.
[2025-03-31T15:17:08.851Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh they're just mappings of.
[2025-03-31T15:17:19.830Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh exactly as as important as that and as easy as that so.
[2025-03-31T15:17:23.352Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: For those those of us who remember uh.
[2025-03-31T15:17:33.901Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah Yellow Pages in the US and and I'm sure other countries had very similar uh directories that mapped phone numbers to.
[2025-03-31T15:17:37.856Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh to business entities for example uh.
[2025-03-31T15:17:43.895Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and we had both um.
[2025-03-31T15:17:55.881Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We have mappings going in in in both directions we could look up by name and get the phone number uh or look up a phone number and and get the name similarly.
[2025-03-31T15:18:06.464Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All that are issued registry is and the same same thing is true for a verifier registry and we'll talk about what those are and what those are for.
[2025-03-31T15:18:09.946Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's just a map of.
[2025-03-31T15:18:12.450Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or or did essentially.
[2025-03-31T15:18:16.967Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Known entities that somebody.
[2025-03-31T15:18:21.448Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Went through the trouble of verifying.
[2025-03-31T15:18:30.969Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And that's the that's the important big asterisk there who who's the somebody who actually did The Entity identity verification.
[2025-03-31T15:18:33.944Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh to to put together this directory.
[2025-03-31T15:18:40.947Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: As as you'll see the issue Registries are only as useful only as good as.
[2025-03-31T15:18:44.461Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The Entity who is hosting those registries.
[2025-03-31T15:18:55.972Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So if you trust the uh Ministry of Education or the Chamber of Commerce or whatever Authority or or even person.
[2025-03-31T15:18:57.960Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That's hosting the registry.
[2025-03-31T15:19:02.454Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That's that level of trust is is um.
[2025-03-31T15:19:06.015Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Directly proportional to how useful the registry is going to be.
[2025-03-31T15:19:11.045Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So how does it work well like what is it uh.
[2025-03-31T15:19:17.029Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We we know that they're a directory mapping identifiers to some information about an entity.
[2025-03-31T15:19:22.983Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You can think of them as 2 different types.
[2025-03-31T15:19:28.509Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And usually most uh issue registry specifications support both.
[2025-03-31T15:19:32.975Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You can download the whole directory.
[2025-03-31T15:19:37.994Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So we just a a flat machine readable file.
[2025-03-31T15:19:44.517Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That has all of the mappings of all of the entries identifiers to entities or.
[2025-03-31T15:19:49.489Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Don't want to especially if the registry is uh is long.
[2025-03-31T15:19:49.640Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  if you don't.
[2025-03-31T15:19:52.511Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I want to uh download the whole thing.
[2025-03-31T15:19:58.507Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Registries typically provide an API service where you can say hey.
[2025-03-31T15:20:03.524Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Key1 2345 who does that belong to and get back some information.
[2025-03-31T15:20:10.022Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What kind of information uh.
[2025-03-31T15:20:12.512Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Anything that you need.
[2025-03-31T15:20:18.519Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To think of it as to populate a user interface screen.
[2025-03-31T15:20:26.532Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If I have a verifiable credential wallet or if I have a verifier software.
[2025-03-31T15:20:49.035Z]	<Chandi_Cumaranatunge>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:20:50.598Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Let's say I'm a Border guard at a checkpoint and I'm I'm scanning uh a license or I'm an admissions officer or I'm a HR professional and I get a resume I was verifiable credential and some diplomas into it and I feed the let's say the diplomas of course credentials into my verifier software.
[2025-03-31T15:20:55.530Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Think about what that verifier software is going to show me on the screen.
[2025-03-31T15:21:13.121Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What would be helpful uh at least the name of the entity and and sometimes especially in um our vertical of um education will often need at least the common name and the legal names right because a lot of universities have uh the.
[2025-03-31T15:21:15.206Z]	<Chandi_Cumaranatunge>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:21:17.086Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the funky thing of like.
[2025-03-31T15:21:29.639Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There's the common University name such as MIT and then there's the legal name which is like uh Ye Olde Trustees of Massachusetts internet of technology or Institute of Technology.
[2025-03-31T15:21:39.090Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Website is helpful if you want to get Advanced maybe the location for disambiguation of uh.
[2025-03-31T15:21:48.604Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If you want to get really Advanced and this is this is going to go into Registries 101 but we can talk about this as well.
[2025-03-31T15:21:50.579Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You can also say.
[2025-03-31T15:21:58.605Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who this entity is but is it authorized to issue these credentials in the first place so.
[2025-03-31T15:21:58.789Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  not all.
[2025-03-31T15:22:07.963Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Only is this uh ABC University but ABC university has been authorized by the state of California.
[2025-03-31T15:22:15.439Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 2 uh issue bachelor's diplomas right so so it's the accreditation aspect of it.
[2025-03-31T15:22:28.454Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh and then also kind of overlooked but really important is not just its current identify its current set of keys that it signs diplomas with.
[2025-03-31T15:22:30.455Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But also all the past ones.
[2025-03-31T15:22:33.461Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and why is that because.
[2025-03-31T15:22:35.525Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Keys get rotated.
[2025-03-31T15:22:45.434Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So 1 of the sort of common security policies uh that to guard against key theft key loss um.
[2025-03-31T15:22:49.965Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Graphic algorithm expiration just a number of things.
[2025-03-31T15:22:56.952Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We've been taught for 4 good reasons that you should rotate Keys regularly.
[2025-03-31T15:22:58.436Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But here's the problem.
[2025-03-31T15:23:04.463Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I graduate the university has 1 key.
[2025-03-31T15:23:09.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh it signs my uh my diploma with it.
[2025-03-31T15:23:11.694Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I go out into the world.
[2025-03-31T15:23:18.670Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And 2 years down the line I'm applying somewhere and I hand over my diploma.
[2025-03-31T15:23:24.194Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But the university is required to rotate its Keys every 3 months.
[2025-03-31T15:23:24.398Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  and now.
[2025-03-31T15:23:26.168Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 2 years past that.
[2025-03-31T15:23:29.398Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	Does this advanced verification (of issuer identity) have to be a part of the registry? Such authorisations (e.g. accreditation and various licences) could be a separate issue not necessarily linked to the Agent's identity
[2025-03-31T15:23:29.649Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Going to know that 2 years ago.
[2025-03-31T15:23:32.164Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They had this key.
[2025-03-31T15:23:39.175Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Somebody's going to keep that uh somebody trusted needs to keep that history.
[2025-03-31T15:23:41.671Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Some did methods.
[2025-03-31T15:23:44.191Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sami Sanchez has identified methods.
[2025-03-31T15:23:52.749Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Keep the key rotation history as part of the Dead mechanism itself like they're required to that's how you know.
[2025-03-31T15:23:56.162Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh it's part of the verification of the did method.
[2025-03-31T15:24:05.784Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But other dead methods such as did Webb such as did key such as a number of other dead methods don't keep that history in the method itself.
[2025-03-31T15:24:05.990Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  so we.
[2025-03-31T15:24:13.775Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That we have to put it somewhere and 1 convenient place to put that history is of course in an issue or registry.
[2025-03-31T15:24:20.756Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Now we get into the all important question of.
[2025-03-31T15:24:20.922Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  all right.
[2025-03-31T15:24:23.770Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So why we need issues.
[2025-03-31T15:24:30.771Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Cryptographic identifiers to figure out who it is that signed something.
[2025-03-31T15:24:34.306Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What are they there their mappings their directories.
[2025-03-31T15:24:38.126Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay who is going to run them.
[2025-03-31T15:24:44.609Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And that right there is the key issue for for all of us to think about because.
[2025-03-31T15:24:50.110Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: At this point in time at this point in the development of verifiable credentials.
[2025-03-31T15:24:52.612Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This is going to be the key question.
[2025-03-31T15:25:11.783Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Very little of it is technical right the format of a mapping format of a directory is is Trivial it's just a dictionary it's just a map that bit is easy all of the hard part is social legal political.
[2025-03-31T15:25:15.258Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who do you trust to run these lists.
[2025-03-31T15:25:18.249Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And how do we.
[2025-03-31T15:25:26.273Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How do we learn from uh the lessons that for example DNS certificates did because if you think about it.
[2025-03-31T15:25:34.264Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Certificates there's a cell certificates are run by registries.
[2025-03-31T15:25:38.748Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And what happened in the in the web world is.
[2025-03-31T15:25:51.273Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Main registrant to the business of issuing these certificates there are these um certificate authorities that most users don't know about and don't care.
[2025-03-31T15:25:56.751Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh for for good reasons right we don't necessarily need users to care.
[2025-03-31T15:26:01.722Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But we'll put an asterisk uh in that and come back to it.
[2025-03-31T15:26:14.787Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But basically it's all built into the browser and at best you see like a little green check mark of like okay this was this was known by this SSL certificate this domain was issued by a known issuer.
[2025-03-31T15:26:22.804Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Of course lately what happened with registry is on the web.
[2025-03-31T15:26:29.793Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is at first it costs a lot to buy an SSL certificate.
[2025-03-31T15:26:42.286Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: For from the domain registar so getting an https URL for your domain was was a significant uh investment until it came down in price to be you know below hundred dollars.
[2025-03-31T15:26:55.367Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It used to be many hundreds of dollars possibly thousands of dollars or you go to your domain registar and say hey in addition to registering the domain give me a certificate meaning.
[2025-03-31T15:26:58.367Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Me an entry in your registry.
[2025-03-31T15:27:05.892Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Because domain certificate is much like verifiable credentials and opaque key that is mapped to.
[2025-03-31T15:27:09.865Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh identity verified.
[2025-03-31T15:27:20.034Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And there are a number of problems with this uh 1 is of course the.
[2025-03-31T15:27:30.474Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Towards centralization the certificate authorities sort of merged and acquired each other there's only I forget a dozen or 2.
[2025-03-31T15:27:35.454Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Of uh Global root authorities that are built into the browser uh currently.
[2025-03-31T15:27:37.431Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But even beyond that.
[2025-03-31T15:27:51.988Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's not possible for us the users of the web to know how much do you diligent due diligence did the registar do in order to hand out that sell certificate.
[2025-03-31T15:27:57.480Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Back this time when on and as the ASL certificates dropped in price.
[2025-03-31T15:28:04.482Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 of the ways that it dropped in price is that the registar.
[2025-03-31T15:28:08.669Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Wasn't standing behind.
[2025-03-31T15:28:16.675Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This this actually happened to me uh researching regards of years ago.
[2025-03-31T15:28:22.186Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To a domain registar to to their pricing page and it said.
[2025-03-31T15:28:25.674Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's how much it costs to get an SSL certificate.
[2025-03-31T15:28:30.180Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We can give you uh as a certificate for like 90 dollars.
[2025-03-31T15:28:35.172Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We can give it to you for like 3,000 or you can give it to you for 10,000.
[2025-03-31T15:28:37.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's the same certificate.
[2025-03-31T15:28:40.170Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's what's the difference between the price there.
[2025-03-31T15:28:43.668Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It turned out that the difference was.
[2025-03-31T15:28:56.666Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That the registar put on themselves essentially the difference uh.
[2025-03-31T15:29:01.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Out to be the amount of due diligence.
[2025-03-31T15:29:06.195Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That the register went through.
[2025-03-31T15:29:06.430Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  in order.
[2025-03-31T15:29:08.723Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Give me the certificate in the first place.
[2025-03-31T15:29:14.222Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Again through the browser you as the user if you go to I don't know ibm.com.
[2025-03-31T15:29:17.203Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You don't know whether IBM.
[2025-03-31T15:29:23.730Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Went through you know went for the free SSL certificate or the fifty dollar 1 or the $10,000 1.
[2025-03-31T15:29:31.231Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That that information is not really surfaced to us as the users.
[2025-03-31T15:29:37.230Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so we should we should think about for verifiable credentials how to.
[2025-03-31T15:29:37.430Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  can we.
[2025-03-31T15:29:38.715Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Better than that.
[2025-03-31T15:29:48.729Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Coming back to uh site tangent on uh a self certificates which are also just another example of an issue of registry.
[2025-03-31T15:29:52.217Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who is going to run.
[2025-03-31T15:29:56.707Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Our issue Registries for verifiable credentials.
[2025-03-31T15:30:02.737Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And the answer as you've you've come to expect in this group is.
[2025-03-31T15:30:06.870Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It depends let's wait and see but here's what we do know.
[2025-03-31T15:30:12.368Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's likely going to be different by the vertical right so in in.
[2025-03-31T15:30:27.394Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Education vertical it's going to be 1 set of authorities in medical licensing going to be another 1 in uh driver's licenses or truck licenses going to be yet another set of authorities and so on right so.
[2025-03-31T15:30:34.859Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The way the ecosystem is shaping up is the.
[2025-03-31T15:30:49.389Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And the the organizations and companies and and government entities running these Registries are going to be slightly closer to the vertical rather than.
[2025-03-31T15:30:52.357Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Technical register is like verisign.
[2025-03-31T15:31:08.473Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Because this is a necessary component of the architecture essentially if we don't have Registries we don't really have a verified credential ecosystem so everything that we're working on in this group kind of depends on this piece of infrastructure.
[2025-03-31T15:31:14.386Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So 1 of the 1 of the work that we're all sort of doing in the background is.
[2025-03-31T15:31:16.899Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Looking to see.
[2025-03-31T15:31:21.376Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In education or even in higher education.
[2025-03-31T15:31:27.891Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who are going to be the the the entities that we trust to run these directories.
[2025-03-31T15:31:35.881Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And what is shaping up to be 1 depends on geographical jurisdiction right so like European Union.
[2025-03-31T15:31:39.885Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Has has some regulation has some strong feelings about.
[2025-03-31T15:31:48.390Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who's allowed to run uh these these Registries that's going to be different from what's in the US it's gonna be different from what it is uh globally.
[2025-03-31T15:31:51.873Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But 1 of the 1 of the things as usual.
[2025-03-31T15:32:03.397Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Like if you're if you're responsible for sort of bootstrapping an entire ecosystem in your vertical 1 of the common techniques is you look for a natural Authority you look for somebody.
[2025-03-31T15:32:05.873Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Hopefully somebody neutral.
[2025-03-31T15:32:11.403Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Directories and lists or lists of accreditations.
[2025-03-31T15:32:19.957Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There you can say hey do you since you're already doing this can you also run this verify the credential issue a registry for us.
[2025-03-31T15:32:22.903Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Um area of Education.
[2025-03-31T15:32:25.887Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh we have.
[2025-03-31T15:32:28.409Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Educating and in common.
[2025-03-31T15:32:30.883Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Who are who already.
[2025-03-31T15:32:41.920Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Keep Registries uh of um saml 2 certificates right they they do it so that you as a student or as a professor if you go to any other university.
[2025-03-31T15:32:42.229Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  uh in the world.
[2025-03-31T15:32:44.883Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: You can use their Wi-Fi.
[2025-03-31T15:32:51.398Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and again how do you use their Wi-Fi under the hood there's an issue a registry.
[2025-03-31T15:32:58.936Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And the the system gets a digital digital signed object from from your home University.
[2025-03-31T15:32:59.160Z]	<Chandi_Cumaranatunge>	present+
[2025-03-31T15:33:02.884Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Looks it up in the registry and says okay yeah this is.
[2025-03-31T15:33:05.493Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: University is a member of.
[2025-03-31T15:33:08.041Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Edugain Edgar Rome.
[2025-03-31T15:33:12.005Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We're gonna give you access right so same sort of deal.
[2025-03-31T15:33:19.019Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: No that's 1 of the parties that that we've approached and said hey do you want to run this registry and fortunately.
[2025-03-31T15:33:28.014Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Interested in doing this work and they've they've joined in the issue registry project uh with us so that we're going to talk about uh in just a second.
[2025-03-31T15:33:48.598Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh DCC the folks that I work with uh the MIT is digital credential Consortium is exactly that a Consortium of a bunch of universities and as 1 of the services provided by the Consortium 1 of the things that we realized we needed in order for verifiable credential and education to work.
[2025-03-31T15:33:50.162Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is if we.
[2025-03-31T15:33:55.013Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Could provide a directory of okay these are a couple dozen members.
[2025-03-31T15:34:04.989Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here are the keys that they used to sign so GCC is going to run uh a registry for its members.
[2025-03-31T15:34:21.544Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Going to be ministries of Education that have some input on the subject there's going to be uh trade associations and and uh companies like in the US we have Acro the American Association of uh something of regards essentially.
[2025-03-31T15:34:29.983Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If we do this right if um.
[2025-03-31T15:34:52.781Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If we set up the infrastructure correctly from a social political standpoint there's going to be many registries.
[2025-03-31T15:34:55.281Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  uh and then of course you get into the fact that.
[2025-03-31T15:34:55.482Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right Human Resources software or.
[2025-03-31T15:34:57.582Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  as um.
[2025-03-31T15:35:00.989Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Verification of of credentials.
[2025-03-31T15:35:02.083Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  as an application developer let's say I write admissions software or I write wallet uh credential wallet software or.
[2025-03-31T15:35:02.186Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: How do I know.
[2025-03-31T15:35:05.006Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: About about all of these.
[2025-03-31T15:35:24.032Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All of these verticals but but for a given vertical who the Registries are going to be like literally what's the URL of the API endpoints of those Registries then I can send a request to you and say who's did 1 2 3 oh that's that's Arizona State University.
[2025-03-31T15:35:32.005Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And what we suspect is going to happen and and there's there's already sort of a project started.
[2025-03-31T15:35:34.476Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh towards this.
[2025-03-31T15:35:50.531Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: These are going to get aggregated into lists of lists into registry of the Registries so that I can hopefully I as a service provider don't need to know all the you know 20 or 100.
[2025-03-31T15:35:57.002Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Registries in my vertical I can just say hey project a uh here's a did can you connect me.
[2025-03-31T15:36:00.503Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: With a registry that does know about it.
[2025-03-31T15:36:04.006Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh and and and they would do that.
[2025-03-31T15:36:11.707Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's here's where we come to sort of the Crux of the matter and let's let's pause here.
[2025-03-31T15:36:17.694Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh and and see do we have any questions on the Queue before we get into.
[2025-03-31T15:36:18.057Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	q?
[2025-03-31T15:36:20.186Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the the.
[2025-03-31T15:36:23.698Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sort of cracks of the matter which is registered governance.
[2025-03-31T15:36:28.952Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Elico please go ahead.
[2025-03-31T15:36:32.921Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yes go ahead.
[2025-03-31T15:37:36.929Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah great great question uh.
[2025-03-31T15:37:40.923Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So like you said.
[2025-03-31T15:37:45.927Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They obviously uh 2 different aspects and we need both.
[2025-03-31T15:37:54.142Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right we need to we need to identify who the University or whatever the issuer is and whether they're credited or not.
[2025-03-31T15:38:02.159Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So so 1 1 way of thinking about what you're asking is are different services.
[2025-03-31T15:38:11.665Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Going to be responsible for those 2 different things do I make a call out to an identity service and then do I make a separate call to an accreditation service Maybe.
[2025-03-31T15:38:15.653Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Spam dancers maybe let's we're going to find out as as of ecosystem.
[2025-03-31T15:38:21.149Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: At the moment what we see is the technical specs.
[2025-03-31T15:38:21.619Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	...and the first (identifier) might be necessary to verify the second (i.e. accredited status)
[2025-03-31T15:38:26.643Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: These Registries they have an affordance they have the feature that says.
[2025-03-31T15:38:31.780Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Here's the identity section here's the accreditation section so.
[2025-03-31T15:38:32.198Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  they at least.
[2025-03-31T15:38:32.411Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Give you the.
[2025-03-31T15:38:35.147Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Of Hosting both in the same service.
[2025-03-31T15:38:44.157Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But nothing is stopping you from using 2 different Services uh from that so it's unclear I suspect just for.
[2025-03-31T15:38:53.160Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Ality and developer convenience they might be combined into 1 service so that instead of 2 HTP calls.
[2025-03-31T15:39:05.884Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To choose different Services I make just 1 right but under the hood of putting together that registry of course different um jurisdiction different uh authorities are going to be.
[2025-03-31T15:39:10.069Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Used to to combine that that information does that make sense.
[2025-03-31T15:40:16.196Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I so I completely agree with you and I suspect we're going to see that everywhere that.
[2025-03-31T15:40:26.626Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Some use cases and some verticals are going to need the accreditation component and for others it's Overkill so yes that exactly that uh what you said.
[2025-03-31T15:40:34.715Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Wearing our hat as technologists and uh.
[2025-03-31T15:40:42.606Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Technical specification creators we need to make sure that the specs that we use at least have that feature.
[2025-03-31T15:40:54.617Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That at least you're able to provide that accreditation information uh the other the other term for it the other technical jargon for citation information uh that I've seen is trust marks.
[2025-03-31T15:40:54.793Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  kind of.
[2025-03-31T15:40:59.115Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Terrible name right because it uses the very loaded terminology of trust.
[2025-03-31T15:41:08.790Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That we kind of want to so mentally translate when you see trust marks in these uh specs think think of it as uh.
[2025-03-31T15:41:18.530Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah other questions uh before we get into the governance.
[2025-03-31T15:41:25.757Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right so.
[2025-03-31T15:41:29.008Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2025-03-31T15:41:30.736Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Got it um so governance.
[2025-03-31T15:41:36.932Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Governance is hard so.
[2025-03-31T15:41:45.501Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This whole thing works.
[2025-03-31T15:41:49.517Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I trust the entity providing.
[2025-03-31T15:41:49.778Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  the registry.
[2025-03-31T15:41:58.041Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I'm in a vertical.
[2025-03-31T15:42:02.525Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Where such trust trustworthy um.
[2025-03-31T15:42:18.145Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Authorities uh exist already whether it's Mischief education whether it's Acro whether it's uh uh I'm Town municipality whether it's a nonprofit that is hosting like here's the.
[2025-03-31T15:42:18.525Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  uh what what.
[2025-03-31T15:42:18.937Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Whether it's a.
[2025-03-31T15:42:30.131Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Journalist that says here's the universities or whatever that I've interviewed here they are and here's here's their keys not that we expect really journalists to to do that but I'm just giving an example that that could be really anyone.
[2025-03-31T15:42:44.117Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What do we mean when we say by governance.
[2025-03-31T15:42:54.668Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's identifying the The Entity who's hosting the the registry.
[2025-03-31T15:43:08.760Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What steps usually we want an explanation of what was the procedure that they went through to kyc to know your customer to to.
[2025-03-31T15:43:09.665Z]	<Ildiko_Mazar>	I suppose school rankings could be such lists too, right?
[2025-03-31T15:43:12.256Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Ify the identity of the entries in there.
[2025-03-31T15:43:29.261Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then what are the terms of service what's the what's the liability what's the guarantee that that they're taking on.
[2025-03-31T15:43:39.235Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right I Demetri could run.
[2025-03-31T15:43:47.894Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A um registry service that says here's some universities that Demitri talked to on the phone.
[2025-03-31T15:43:54.707Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In the section under what's a liability none use at your own risk right that's 1 end of the spectrum.
[2025-03-31T15:43:57.277Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then on the other end of the spectrum is.
[2025-03-31T15:44:22.389Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh this is this list is run by Ministry of Education uh here are the here's the procedures that we went through for each University on there these are the forms that we required uh we talked to I don't know the the registar on the phone or on video uh these are the passports of the people involved on file like as detailed and as as crazy as you want to get.
[2025-03-31T15:44:31.284Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So 1 of the social and Technical challenges that we have is.
[2025-03-31T15:44:41.329Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Both as organizers of these Registries but more more likely as consumers of the Registries as creators of software or writers of policy.
[2025-03-31T15:44:41.601Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  we're going to need.
[2025-03-31T15:44:43.308Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To figure this stuff out.
[2025-03-31T15:44:43.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  at the moment.
[2025-03-31T15:44:46.322Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Moment to the state of the art is.
[2025-03-31T15:44:48.524Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  there's a.
[2025-03-31T15:44:51.823Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Governance page there's a government's document kind of like.
[2025-03-31T15:45:07.555Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A terms of service on any website or any software that you install right the the thing that everybody clicks through and and never looks at um because we know it's uh it's opaque and hopeless anyways uh hopefully we can do slightly better than that but.
[2025-03-31T15:45:12.985Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Usually governance means a government's policy document somewhere.
[2025-03-31T15:45:26.007Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Will we ever get to a point where that governance policy document is machine readable or machine processable with or without Ai and llms maybe the moment.
[2025-03-31T15:45:34.493Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: We're hoping to just have human readable documents that says uh this is such a so.
[2025-03-31T15:45:37.478Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What what are the reasons I'm mentioning it is.
[2025-03-31T15:45:42.980Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Ultimately a human has to be in the loop.
[2025-03-31T15:45:50.483Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The question is who and how often right we want to set it up so that.
[2025-03-31T15:45:58.979Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Each individual user verifying a credential doesn't need to be a uh policy expert.
[2025-03-31T15:46:07.118Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so they they trust essentially they they delegate the decision.
[2025-03-31T15:46:13.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To the creator of the software of their verification software they they trust that.
[2025-03-31T15:46:16.614Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Whichever registry the software is checking.
[2025-03-31T15:46:30.644Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Good ones they did their due diligence now of course we want to present the information um to the users as much as possible so for example uh I'm going to talk about the trust registry project in just a second but.
[2025-03-31T15:46:33.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: At the DCC the DCC wallet.
[2025-03-31T15:46:35.608Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 of the.
[2025-03-31T15:46:38.102Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Confidential 1 of the.
[2025-03-31T15:46:43.611Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Challenges that we're discussing right now and making changes to your software is.
[2025-03-31T15:46:46.090Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Okay so each credential.
[2025-03-31T15:46:49.625Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The issuer is checked against a number of registries.
[2025-03-31T15:46:53.112Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What's the best way of telling the user that.
[2025-03-31T15:46:53.364Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  uh and.
[2025-03-31T15:46:57.598Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And at the moment what we're we're heading towards is saying.
[2025-03-31T15:47:01.601Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the part that identifies the issuer.
[2025-03-31T15:47:07.666Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is the the part where it says MIT issued this diploma.
[2025-03-31T15:47:10.650Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That name is taken from a registry.
[2025-03-31T15:47:14.651Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then we list which Registries were checked so we can say.
[2025-03-31T15:47:14.889Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  all right.
[2025-03-31T15:47:31.175Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The issue appears to be mitt how do we know because we checked the DCC issuer registry we checked the uh The Edge you gain 1 the acro and the California Ministry of Education or whatever.
[2025-03-31T15:47:33.647Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right we so we.
[2025-03-31T15:47:37.160Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Surface to the user to the UI.
[2025-03-31T15:47:39.127Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Some of this information.
[2025-03-31T15:47:42.123Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: With both the.
[2025-03-31T15:47:52.662Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The software so do you see creating the wallet we maintain that list of of Registries that we were checking right and and it's up to us to do our due diligence to.
[2025-03-31T15:47:55.652Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To read through the policy governance.
[2025-03-31T15:47:59.168Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Documents for each 1 and say okay is this a trustworthy.
[2025-03-31T15:48:04.153Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or or you know is this a useful registry for us to check.
[2025-03-31T15:48:12.191Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But in addition to our judgment as a software vendors not vendors uh creators.
[2025-03-31T15:48:20.693Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In addition we want to surface that information to the user so that the user can double-check us to say oh okay uh so this this registry.
[2025-03-31T15:48:23.231Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh this is sure.
[2025-03-31T15:48:29.218Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is in the Ministry of Education registry okay seems legit uh this issue is unknown.
[2025-03-31T15:48:45.211Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and what do I do with that information or this issuer is in Demitri's Fly by Night registry right I exaggerated for a fact because if it is fly fly by night and not that useful why is it in the list in the first place.
[2025-03-31T15:48:48.376Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The the software creator.
[2025-03-31T15:48:48.565Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  can see.
[2025-03-31T15:48:52.011Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That it's useful but the user might not so we're going to.
[2025-03-31T15:48:54.967Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: This stage in the game we're going to try and.
[2025-03-31T15:49:08.722Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh let the user at least uh make their own decisions but we we also understand that especially depending on the vertical the user is not going to know some of these authorities right like this is where government steps in this is where legislation steps in this is where.
[2025-03-31T15:49:11.637Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Social contracts step in.
[2025-03-31T15:49:16.147Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 1 other thing that I want to.
[2025-03-31T15:49:21.155Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That I want to highlight which is not obvious is.
[2025-03-31T15:49:27.655Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In thinking about who can be trusted to run these registries.
[2025-03-31T15:49:39.208Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Especially for selfish credentials especially for personal issue credential and what's an example of that a resume a resume is uh I'm applying to a job.
[2025-03-31T15:49:45.669Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I am making a number of claims about myself issued by me.
[2025-03-31T15:49:57.681Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And then it's up to the verifier the HR office to uh double-check those claims but that's a that's a verifiable credential and I'm going to sign with my own personal key.
[2025-03-31T15:50:01.140Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That key that I put on my resume.
[2025-03-31T15:50:01.375Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  is that.
[2025-03-31T15:50:04.648Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Going to be in any directory anywhere unlikely.
[2025-03-31T15:50:15.759Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Smart and diligent jurisdictions like the European Union specifically forbid person level.
[2025-03-31T15:50:19.772Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So what do we do in that case.
[2025-03-31T15:50:27.282Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And the answer is unclear the the field is is trying to figure it out uh but 1 1 thing that I want to highlight.
[2025-03-31T15:50:46.294Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is that essentially we all already carry uh direct our own personal trust Registries uh sorry issuer Registries our own directories with us already in our mobile phones in our address books.
[2025-03-31T15:50:48.262Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's the difference between.
[2025-03-31T15:50:50.793Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I get a call unknown number.
[2025-03-31T15:51:07.238Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh unknown number but suspected as spam what does that mean it means the software checked against uh a registry provided by my cell phone carrier and said okay yeah this is this is a good chance that it's spam or.
[2025-03-31T15:51:16.803Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It's uh Demetri's friend Joe that's calling oh okay how do I know that because the phone checked an issue a registry which happened to be my address book.
[2025-03-31T15:51:33.126Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And we all know that um address books carry phone numbers and emails uh but also there's a field there's literally a field for key identifiers for account IDs in there so what 1 thing that I want to.
[2025-03-31T15:51:39.505Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh sort of plant a seed and everybody's mind is that especially for personal credentials.
[2025-03-31T15:51:50.094Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh while this whole infrastructure is booting up don't forget about address books as a complimentary component uh to these registries.
[2025-03-31T15:51:53.572Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh we're nearing the top of the hour so let's uh.
[2025-03-31T15:51:56.682Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Let's make sure we cover a couple more.
[2025-03-31T15:51:58.356Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All right so.
[2025-03-31T15:52:03.885Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If you're involved in building this technology or writing spec uh writing policy.
[2025-03-31T15:52:13.039Z]	<Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_🇨🇦>	Levels of confidence useful here, mapped to criteria IMO
[2025-03-31T15:52:14.024Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: What are the specs what are the technical specifications that describe how to run these Registries there's a handful uh there's open ID federations uh.
[2025-03-31T15:52:16.010Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Sorry open ID foundations.
[2025-03-31T15:52:18.536Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Federation 1.0 spec.
[2025-03-31T15:52:24.761Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There's the w3c uh ccg verifiable issues and verifiers.
[2025-03-31T15:52:28.669Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There's uh diffs that's the decentralized identifiers Foundation.
[2025-03-31T15:52:32.199Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh credential trust establishments back.
[2025-03-31T15:52:33.691Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: There's many others.
[2025-03-31T15:52:38.707Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh because there's there's all these um all these specs.
[2025-03-31T15:52:54.619Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Mit's digital credential Consortium credential engine and a couple of other organizations uh got a got a fund uh sorry got a grant to try and make sense of this to go through.
[2025-03-31T15:52:54.878Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  some of.
[2025-03-31T15:52:59.590Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: These existing specifications and they're all drafts because it's all it's all still early.
[2025-03-31T15:53:04.565Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh to compare and contrast them figure out what each 1 is trying to do.
[2025-03-31T15:53:09.749Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and run a year-long pilot.
[2025-03-31T15:53:22.770Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And of course share the learnings uh do education Outreach so that's the issue registry project that that I uh mentioned earlier so that's that's something my team credential engine and others are are involved in.
[2025-03-31T15:53:36.772Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And just to like spoiler we in we evaluated all these specifications and I decided to go with open ID Federation as our initial uh specification to implement.
[2025-03-31T15:53:36.952Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  to learn.
[2025-03-31T15:53:44.762Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: From and so on uh because we feel it's uh it's very simple and it has the most sort of current momentum.
[2025-03-31T15:53:44.996Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  of of.
[2025-03-31T15:54:00.802Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Of implementers that there's a bunch of uh countries in Europe for example like Italy and Sweden Sweden that have implemented it that that are that are experimenting with it so we went with it as well.
[2025-03-31T15:54:07.744Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: But essentially all of these do the same thing they they may have slightly different features and slightly uh different.
[2025-03-31T15:54:21.770Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Aspects to them but they're all either a flat file mapping identifiers to entities or an API that says hey what's a key 1 2 3 oh it's this entity here.
[2025-03-31T15:54:26.253Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Or or in many cases uh both.
[2025-03-31T15:54:33.784Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Encourage everyone to check out some of these blog posts and and uh.
[2025-03-31T15:54:39.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Mitts and credentials uh.
[2025-03-31T15:54:46.401Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A research on the subject okay I heard a uh Q sound so that's illico go ahead.
[2025-03-31T15:55:22.553Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh great question what is vat.
[2025-03-31T15:55:26.484Z]	<Nate_Otto>	Value Added Tax
[2025-03-31T15:55:36.046Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh yeah I'm not I'm not familiar with that at all uh I'm I'm not sure oh but probably that that's because they already.
[2025-03-31T15:55:39.556Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I I I think it's a government um.
[2025-03-31T15:56:02.515Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Government entity that has that mapping of opaque identifiers your your vat number to who it is that it represents yeah that's that's 1 natural authority to try and talk to and say hey do do you want to stand behind this registry and they might tell you that know for example in the US we have uh.
[2025-03-31T15:56:07.798Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh much much maligned uh Social Security.
[2025-03-31T15:56:07.992Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  I mean.
[2025-03-31T15:56:15.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Administration that runs a directory of social security numbers to like to People to kyc People.
[2025-03-31T15:56:19.382Z]	<Nate_Otto>	VAT registries are unlikely to include the DID identifiers that we'd like to map to a registry entry, but that authority could be extended to add support for these identifiers. They have the org metadata, but they don't yet have the credential issuance DIDs associated with these orgs.
[2025-03-31T15:56:22.797Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That conversation came up with them in the US government hey Social Security Administration.
[2025-03-31T15:56:36.302Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Do you want to be do you want to run a registry and they're like no we don't have the funds for it we don't want to be responsible for it go away don't use our don't don't use our identifiers for this stuff so.
[2025-03-31T15:56:40.010Z]	<Sharon_Leu>	Is someone working with Duns and Bradstreet?
[2025-03-31T15:56:49.040Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They might say oh yeah this is this is a good uh I don't know uh chance for us to get lots of um Government funding yeah we'll we'll take that on or it'll be like no forget it.
[2025-03-31T15:56:57.485Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: And and as um I think Nate points out in uh in chat that they're unlikely to use.
[2025-03-31T15:57:12.238Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: At the moment they certainly don't have data did information uh would they be interested in it uh unclear probably not uh we have um also Ted on the Queue go ahead Ted.
[2025-03-31T15:57:17.153Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh no worries.
[2025-03-31T15:57:29.673Z]	<Transcriber>	TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Oh sorry that's an accidental queue but um I was typing oh there we are actually laws against using these social security number for any purpose other than tracking Social Security and tax information that's the only place it's allowed to be used and that's for decades ago.
[2025-03-31T15:57:32.025Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah yeah and.
[2025-03-31T15:57:34.973Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Yeah so so and.
[2025-03-31T15:57:50.061Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: In in recent like couple couple years ago or or more recent like the for example Department of Homeland Security came again to Social Security Administration is like hey do you want to reconsider know we don't go away so.
[2025-03-31T15:58:10.688Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: It'll depend uh Sharon in chat asks uh is anybody working with duns and Bradstreet duns and Bradstreet the the what is the DNB number uh is also a great example of such a directory literally an opaque identifier like a random number uh mapped to a known entity here's the interesting part about it.
[2025-03-31T15:58:28.514Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so so 1 are they going to be interested in running such a thing I suspect so uh I haven't talked to them personally they they might not be aware of uh this opportunity so somebody should talk to them uh they're a great example because they're a great example of why governance is important.
[2025-03-31T15:58:34.135Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Would they be an actual fit for running such a directory yes.
[2025-03-31T15:58:46.245Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: However how useful such a directory uh it depends on how much kyc they're willing to do behind each entry what the liability and what the terms of service are.
[2025-03-31T15:58:47.715Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: To put it plainly.
[2025-03-31T15:58:53.331Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I can I can get uh dunan uh DNB number.
[2025-03-31T15:59:03.419Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Very easily without much documentation right I can say hey I run this company here it is and get a number.
[2025-03-31T15:59:12.670Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh a couple days later without without much document so could I register uh a university with them or some something equivalent yes.
[2025-03-31T15:59:13.947Z]	<TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com)>	One other Social Security note -- the *number* is not uniquely assigned; the *combination of name and number* is uniquely assigned.
[2025-03-31T15:59:22.177Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so it's 1 of those buyer beware things uh if if they decide to.
[2025-03-31T15:59:28.365Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: If they decide this is a business opportunity and they're going to focus on it they they'll need to figure out how much.
[2025-03-31T15:59:35.147Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Identification they're going to do what their terms of service are going to be how much liability they're going to be right so like.
[2025-03-31T15:59:38.733Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Pay attention to the fine print basically.
[2025-03-31T15:59:55.290Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh oh Ted also points out Social Security it's not that the numbers uniquely assigned it's specifically the combination of name and number that is unique that's interesting I did not know that that's cool tidbit all right uh other other questions.
[2025-03-31T15:59:57.747Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: As we near the top of the hour.
[2025-03-31T16:00:02.745Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So let's let's summarize.
[2025-03-31T16:00:07.063Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: 5 F credentials we need registries.
[2025-03-31T16:00:07.278Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  in order.
[2025-03-31T16:00:19.002Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Order to make any any of this work specially in open world scenarios what do I mean by that well for example in um the true age.
[2025-03-31T16:00:23.911Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Age verification project IT issues verifiable credentials.
[2025-03-31T16:00:24.160Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  does it.
[2025-03-31T16:00:30.782Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: A uh issue a registry behind it no because there's only 1 issuer.
[2025-03-31T16:00:30.972Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  which is.
[2025-03-31T16:00:34.335Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: The North American Association of convenience stores.
[2025-03-31T16:00:38.918Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Like we're going to issue the credentials and that's it so the verifier software.
[2025-03-31T16:00:43.769Z]	<David_Ward>	present+
[2025-03-31T16:00:50.942Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: All we need to know about 1 is her except they too rotate keys so it's really it's not even just 1 key ID that they need that the verifier needs to know about it's the history of the keys but still.
[2025-03-31T16:01:23.350Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: They can they can go to uh uh hard-coded place on uh the next website and then download the key history and work like that so they don't need necessarily a full-on issue register but that's because it's a very narrow sort of closed world use case where there's only 1 issue or and a bunch of verifiers and they can coordinate the moment you have multiple issuers like with education universities that's where you need these Registries that's why we need this information.
[2025-03-31T16:01:33.740Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh the tech behind it is easy go look at the specs the governance is hard as usual nothing we can do about it uh buyer beware and read the fee print.
[2025-03-31T16:01:35.051Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2025-03-31T16:01:38.890Z]	<Sharon_Leu>	Thanks for this great overview!
[2025-03-31T16:01:51.737Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I'll just check for last moment questions uh thank you everyone uh talk to you all uh if not next week uh because I think a number of us are going to be at IBEW then definitely the week after and thanks Sharon.
[2025-03-31T16:01:52.064Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  bye everyone.

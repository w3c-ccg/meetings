Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Are you recording a lot okay looks like it's 
  recording.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah there we go there's the transcriber.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's do uh introductions of reintroductions 
  if anybody's new uh to the call and wants to uh introduce 
  themselves.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A communion announcements uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Have uh internet identity Workshop W coming up 
  um the week of I believe it's April 8th.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Um Tuesday through Thursday I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A lot of uh really interesting um 
  specifications that this task force deals with uh get incubated 
  there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm sure there's there's other um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Conferences that that I'm that I'm missing uh 
  please feel free to add uh to the chat as Community reminders.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right any other any other announcements or 
  reminders before we Dive In.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah there we go.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's the recording okay.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_üá®üá¶> ePIC 2025 OCt 21-23 in Paris 
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh yeah so speaking of recording.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the granches community group ccg have has 
  recently um announced that we're um.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_üá®üá¶> ..open.. 8->
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Transitioning to a different uh recording and 
  transcription infrastructure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Short of it is uh we're going to try using 
  Google Google meet uh with uh some open source AI transcription 
  uh that's.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Testing has been uh fairly dramatically better 
  than the transcriber here so uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can look forward to hopefully better uh 
  transcription and recording quality and um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Another familiar interface hopefully all of us 
  have used Google meet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So we'll keep you uh we'll keep you posted on 
  the progress there.
<ildiko_mazar> That's not very difficult, TBH :-)
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's uh yeah low bar uh low bar to Ico.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so let's uh jump into our main topic 
  uh which is.
Dmitri Zagidulin: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15RXxjlgNaLSxgXqceZvUmw52Dq6X4bx0H5Oi_WEwe7I
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Issuer and verify Registries 101 uh so here 
  are the slides again in chat.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And so I will share screen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And please feel free to ask questions as we go 
  so uh click the raise hand icon or type Q Plus in GC chat and 
  you'll get added to the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We'll we'll have uh time for questions uh 
  afterwards but it's all also helpful so that we don't forget.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Um to ask.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The questions as we go all right hopefully 
  here we go.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can everybody see presentation mode.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Fantastic all right so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's what we're going to talk about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's the tldr so to speak 1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm going to do anything with verifiable 
  credentials for most cases most open world cases which I think.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Most of us are here for in this task force to 
  do.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Going to need registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And why is that we'll get into it uh but 
  basically because cryptographic identifiers are opaque and we 
  need to on opaque them all right we're gonna talk about how 
  Registries work what goes into 1 going to mention uh a little 
  some of the issues with registry governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Talk about um some projects specifications and 
  further resources that uh you can look into to find out more.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Let's step.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Back quick reminder uh because this is going 
  to be important it's going to lead to why exactly we need.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What's a credential set of claims.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What's a claim uh just a statement think of 
  them for in in crude technical terms they're going to be key 
  value pairs they're going to be uh somebody said something okay.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  As usual we've got a whole range of 
  credentials from uh low value bare credentials that uh typically 
  don't have bindings to to an identity such as you know a movie 
  ticket or I don't know a lottery ticket or something.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh that can be anonymous we we call those 
  barrier credentials and then we have a whole world of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Find credentials that are bound to a 
  particular identity such as passport diploma even play plane 
  tickets uh they can be bound to a cryptographic identity meaning.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This credential was issued to somebody that 
  has a possession of this key.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 To 345 or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This uh credential was issued specifically to 
  Demetrius agodon okay and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Of course.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh only a name is used we get into issues of 
  uh duplicate names and how do you deduplicate.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Don't get into that but.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the hopefully the the idea is clear.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So if credential is a set of claims what's a 
  verifiable credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's machine readable document that has some 
  claims has some metadata about the claims and has some sort of 
  cryptographic proof typically a signature so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 More claims such as MIT claims or says that 
  Alice has a PHD in public education.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Or more um attributes about the credential 
  itself such as this credential is only good until next year.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Also this this credential was issued by MIT.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then third has a digital signature.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then that's going to be there's going to 
  be the key Parts uh this is going to be key to understanding 
  about why we need Registries in the first place because it's uh 
  it's very easy when you first hear about verifiable credential to 
  to hear about it and say oh okay hey the credentials are signed 
  therefore we know exactly who signed it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What we do and we don't we know exactly the 
  identity of the key that signed it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But nothing else about that for anything else 
  nothing else beyond that like who that key belongs to uh is it 
  authorized is it expired etc etc.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For any sort of useful real world information 
  about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So so is does this key actually belong to MIT 
  we need registries.
<ildiko_mazar> RE: credential definition, I would argue that from 
  the 2 presented on your first slide, Dmitri, the first might be 
  too restricted for some more complex credentials (e.g. joint 
  degrees): ‚ÄúA credential is a set of one or more claims *made by 
  the same entity*.‚Äù
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh again to uh sort of restate it uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In different way.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Have a credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Often have.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Identifiers that doesn't though it doesn't 
  need to has a number of claims such as name and address and date 
  of birth or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Date of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sub subject of study for the diploma and so 
  on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's got uh a number of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Find um metadata Fields about the credential 
  itself when was it issued when does it expire.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What are the terms of service usage how do you 
  render the credential in a in a browser or in a mobile phone all 
  that kind of stuff.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And of course the digital signature.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's uh 1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Just 1 example of what that looks like in 
  machine readable form so this is some Json again we've got the 
  optional credential identifier we have a number of claims such as 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The name of the person the university they're 
  an alumni of uh got an example of um internationalization and 
  localization.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Which is a constant topic uh for us here in 
  this group.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We've got some metadata about the credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Such as this is who he was issued by and here 
  we start to see the problem.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Got issuer key 1 to key 1 to 3 for 5 who is 
  that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Like we we have we have strong cryptographic 
  proof that the entity signing this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is definitely key 1 2 3 4 5.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who does that keep belong to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And that's all we know about the signature uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So to get back to why we need issue Registries 
  we need them because cryptographic identifiers are opaque.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We need.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To do something useful with them we need to 
  unop them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At the other end when you hand over the 
  diploma to an admissions office to an employer's desk to uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Random person checking on the street.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They're going to run.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Tribal credential through a verify function.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Verify function can only tell them 2 things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is the signature valid yes or no.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And what key identifier it was signed by.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   That's it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So all of the all of the heavy lifting of um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who that key belongs to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can't be done by the automatic verification 
  code can't be done by the libraries that are just checking the 
  digital signature we need to build additional infrastructure 
  around it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh those of you who have who have been in uh 
  identity case or or have been thinking about this uh for a while 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can probably say hey what about can we 
  sign with websites right does it have to be opaque key 
  identifiers does it have to be did key don't we at least have did 
  web and similar mechanisms.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Don't we have the for example the well-known 
  mechanism for for websites can't we use that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yes of course we can uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But as we all know from.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  History of the web fishing uh and and just 
  just using a browser.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Knowing the website of an entity doesn't 100% 
  translate to uh knowing exactly.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where that website came from.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We we know that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Websites can be slightly misspelled can have 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  International uh characters that look like 
  different letters right so so basically you can fake websites or 
  even if the website is not fake.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Didn't look just looking at a website there's 
  no automated and oftentimes there's no even uh human assisted way 
  of knowing that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This is this is a legit entity that should be 
  signing this credential in the first place.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What's uh 30 years of History.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of of the worldwide web and all of the 
  problems from uh DNS and and certificate authorities.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can we do even slightly better with verifiable 
  credentials can we have some of the problems.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In order to do that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Need this infrastructure of issue of 
  Registries we need to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Build in identity verification from the very 
  start.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Okay so what are.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Having taking all of that detour through 
  what's a verifiable credential uh and why we need Registries in 
  the first place Registries are just directories.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh they're just mappings of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh exactly as as important as that and as easy 
  as that so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For those those of us who remember uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah Yellow Pages in the US and and I'm sure 
  other countries had very similar uh directories that mapped phone 
  numbers to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to business entities for example uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and we had both um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We have mappings going in in in both 
  directions we could look up by name and get the phone number uh 
  or look up a phone number and and get the name similarly.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All that are issued registry is and the same 
  same thing is true for a verifier registry and we'll talk about 
  what those are and what those are for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's just a map of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Or or did essentially.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Known entities that somebody.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Went through the trouble of verifying.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And that's the that's the important big 
  asterisk there who who's the somebody who actually did The Entity 
  identity verification.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to to put together this directory.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  As as you'll see the issue Registries are only 
  as useful only as good as.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The Entity who is hosting those registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So if you trust the uh Ministry of Education 
  or the Chamber of Commerce or whatever Authority or or even 
  person.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's hosting the registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's that level of trust is is um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Directly proportional to how useful the 
  registry is going to be.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So how does it work well like what is it uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We we know that they're a directory mapping 
  identifiers to some information about an entity.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can think of them as 2 different types.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And usually most uh issue registry 
  specifications support both.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can download the whole directory.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So we just a a flat machine readable file.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That has all of the mappings of all of the 
  entries identifiers to entities or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Don't want to especially if the registry is uh 
  is long.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   If you don't.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I want to uh download the whole thing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Registries typically provide an API service 
  where you can say hey.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Key1 2345 who does that belong to and get back 
  some information.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What kind of information uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Anything that you need.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To think of it as to populate a user interface 
  screen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If I have a verifiable credential wallet or if 
  I have a verifier software.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's say I'm a Border guard at a checkpoint 
  and I'm I'm scanning uh a license or I'm an admissions officer or 
  I'm a HR professional and I get a resume I was verifiable 
  credential and some diplomas into it and I feed the let's say the 
  diplomas of course credentials into my verifier software.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Think about what that verifier software is 
  going to show me on the screen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What would be helpful uh at least the name of 
  the entity and and sometimes especially in um our vertical of um 
  education will often need at least the common name and the legal 
  names right because a lot of universities have uh the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the funky thing of like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's the common University name such as MIT 
  and then there's the legal name which is like uh Ye Olde Trustees 
  of Massachusetts internet of technology or Institute of 
  Technology.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Website is helpful if you want to get Advanced 
  maybe the location for disambiguation of uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If you want to get really Advanced and this is 
  this is going to go into Registries 101 but we can talk about 
  this as well.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can also say.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who this entity is but is it authorized to 
  issue these credentials in the first place so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Not all.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Only is this uh ABC University but ABC 
  university has been authorized by the state of California.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  2 Uh issue bachelor's diplomas right so so 
  it's the accreditation aspect of it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and then also kind of overlooked but really 
  important is not just its current identify its current set of 
  keys that it signs diplomas with.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But also all the past ones.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and why is that because.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Keys get rotated.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So 1 of the sort of common security policies 
  uh that to guard against key theft key loss um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Graphic algorithm expiration just a number of 
  things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We've been taught for 4 good reasons that you 
  should rotate Keys regularly.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But here's the problem.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I graduate the university has 1 key.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh it signs my uh my diploma with it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I go out into the world.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And 2 years down the line I'm applying 
  somewhere and I hand over my diploma.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But the university is required to rotate its 
  Keys every 3 months.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And now.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  2 Years past that.
<ildiko_mazar> Does this advanced verification (of issuer 
  identity) have to be a part of the registry? Such authorisations 
  (e.g. accreditation and various licences) could be a separate 
  issue not necessarily linked to the Agent's identity
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Going to know that 2 years ago.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They had this key.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Somebody's going to keep that uh somebody 
  trusted needs to keep that history.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some did methods.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sami Sanchez has identified methods.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Keep the key rotation history as part of the 
  Dead mechanism itself like they're required to that's how you 
  know.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh it's part of the verification of the did 
  method.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But other dead methods such as did Webb such 
  as did key such as a number of other dead methods don't keep that 
  history in the method itself.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   So we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That we have to put it somewhere and 1 
  convenient place to put that history is of course in an issue or 
  registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Now we get into the all important question of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   All right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So why we need issues.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Cryptographic identifiers to figure out who it 
  is that signed something.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What are they there their mappings their 
  directories.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay who is going to run them.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And that right there is the key issue for for 
  all of us to think about because.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At this point in time at this point in the 
  development of verifiable credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This is going to be the key question.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Very little of it is technical right the 
  format of a mapping format of a directory is is Trivial it's just 
  a dictionary it's just a map that bit is easy all of the hard 
  part is social legal political.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who do you trust to run these lists.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And how do we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do we learn from uh the lessons that for 
  example DNS certificates did because if you think about it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Certificates there's a cell certificates are 
  run by registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And what happened in the in the web world is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Main registrant to the business of issuing 
  these certificates there are these um certificate authorities 
  that most users don't know about and don't care.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh for for good reasons right we don't 
  necessarily need users to care.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But we'll put an asterisk uh in that and come 
  back to it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But basically it's all built into the browser 
  and at best you see like a little green check mark of like okay 
  this was this was known by this SSL certificate this domain was 
  issued by a known issuer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of course lately what happened with registry 
  is on the web.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is at first it costs a lot to buy an SSL 
  certificate.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For from the domain registar so getting an 
  https URL for your domain was was a significant uh investment 
  until it came down in price to be you know below hundred dollars.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It used to be many hundreds of dollars 
  possibly thousands of dollars or you go to your domain registar 
  and say hey in addition to registering the domain give me a 
  certificate meaning.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Me an entry in your registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Because domain certificate is much like 
  verifiable credentials and opaque key that is mapped to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh identity verified.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And there are a number of problems with this 
  uh 1 is of course the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Towards centralization the certificate 
  authorities sort of merged and acquired each other there's only I 
  forget a dozen or 2.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of uh Global root authorities that are built 
  into the browser uh currently.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But even beyond that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's not possible for us the users of the web 
  to know how much do you diligent due diligence did the registar 
  do in order to hand out that sell certificate.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Back this time when on and as the ASL 
  certificates dropped in price.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Of the ways that it dropped in price is that 
  the registar.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wasn't standing behind.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This this actually happened to me uh 
  researching regards of years ago.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To a domain registar to to their pricing page 
  and it said.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's how much it costs to get an SSL 
  certificate.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can give you uh as a certificate for like 
  90 dollars.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can give it to you for like 3,000 or you 
  can give it to you for 10,000.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's the same certificate.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What's what's the difference between the price 
  there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It turned out that the difference was.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That the registar put on themselves 
  essentially the difference uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Out to be the amount of due diligence.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That the register went through.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   In order.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Give me the certificate in the first place.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Again through the browser you as the user if 
  you go to I don't know ibm.com.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You don't know whether IBM.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Went through you know went for the free SSL 
  certificate or the fifty dollar 1 or the $10,000 1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That that information is not really surfaced 
  to us as the users.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so we should we should think about for 
  verifiable credentials how to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Can we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Better than that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Coming back to uh site tangent on uh a self 
  certificates which are also just another example of an issue of 
  registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who is going to run.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Our issue Registries for verifiable 
  credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the answer as you've you've come to expect 
  in this group is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It depends let's wait and see but here's what 
  we do know.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's likely going to be different by the 
  vertical right so in in.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Education vertical it's going to be 1 set of 
  authorities in medical licensing going to be another 1 in uh 
  driver's licenses or truck licenses going to be yet another set 
  of authorities and so on right so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The way the ecosystem is shaping up is the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the the organizations and companies and 
  and government entities running these Registries are going to be 
  slightly closer to the vertical rather than.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Technical register is like verisign.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Because this is a necessary component of the 
  architecture essentially if we don't have Registries we don't 
  really have a verified credential ecosystem so everything that 
  we're working on in this group kind of depends on this piece of 
  infrastructure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So 1 of the 1 of the work that we're all sort 
  of doing in the background is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Looking to see.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In education or even in higher education.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who are going to be the the the entities that 
  we trust to run these directories.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And what is shaping up to be 1 depends on 
  geographical jurisdiction right so like European Union.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Has has some regulation has some strong 
  feelings about.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who's allowed to run uh these these Registries 
  that's going to be different from what's in the US it's gonna be 
  different from what it is uh globally.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But 1 of the 1 of the things as usual.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Like if you're if you're responsible for sort 
  of bootstrapping an entire ecosystem in your vertical 1 of the 
  common techniques is you look for a natural Authority you look 
  for somebody.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Hopefully somebody neutral.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Directories and lists or lists of 
  accreditations.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There you can say hey do you since you're 
  already doing this can you also run this verify the credential 
  issue a registry for us.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Um area of Education.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh we have.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Educating and in common.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who are who already.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Keep Registries uh of um saml 2 certificates 
  right they they do it so that you as a student or as a professor 
  if you go to any other university.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh in the world.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You can use their Wi-Fi.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and again how do you use their Wi-Fi under 
  the hood there's an issue a registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the the system gets a digital digital 
  signed object from from your home University.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Looks it up in the registry and says okay yeah 
  this is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  University is a member of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Edugain Edgar Rome.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We're gonna give you access right so same sort 
  of deal.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  No that's 1 of the parties that that we've 
  approached and said hey do you want to run this registry and 
  fortunately.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Interested in doing this work and they've 
  they've joined in the issue registry project uh with us so that 
  we're going to talk about uh in just a second.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh DCC the folks that I work with uh the MIT 
  is digital credential Consortium is exactly that a Consortium of 
  a bunch of universities and as 1 of the services provided by the 
  Consortium 1 of the things that we realized we needed in order 
  for verifiable credential and education to work.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is if we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Could provide a directory of okay these are a 
  couple dozen members.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here are the keys that they used to sign so 
  GCC is going to run uh a registry for its members.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Going to be ministries of Education that have 
  some input on the subject there's going to be uh trade 
  associations and and uh companies like in the US we have Acro the 
  American Association of uh something of regards essentially.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If we do this right if um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If we set up the infrastructure correctly from 
  a social political standpoint there's going to be many 
  registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh and then of course you get into the fact 
  that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right Human Resources software or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   As um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Verification of of credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   As an application developer let's say I write 
  admissions software or I write wallet uh credential wallet 
  software or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How do I know.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  About about all of these.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All of these verticals but but for a given 
  vertical who the Registries are going to be like literally what's 
  the URL of the API endpoints of those Registries then I can send 
  a request to you and say who's did 1 2 3 oh that's that's Arizona 
  State University.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And what we suspect is going to happen and and 
  there's there's already sort of a project started.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh towards this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  These are going to get aggregated into lists 
  of lists into registry of the Registries so that I can hopefully 
  I as a service provider don't need to know all the you know 20 or 
  100.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Registries in my vertical I can just say hey 
  project a uh here's a did can you connect me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  With a registry that does know about it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and and and they would do that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's here's where we come to sort of the 
  Crux of the matter and let's let's pause here.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and and see do we have any questions on the 
  Queue before we get into.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sort of cracks of the matter which is 
  registered governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Elico please go ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yes go ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah great great question uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So like you said.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They obviously uh 2 different aspects and we 
  need both.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right we need to we need to identify who the 
  University or whatever the issuer is and whether they're credited 
  or not.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So so 1 1 way of thinking about what you're 
  asking is are different services.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Going to be responsible for those 2 different 
  things do I make a call out to an identity service and then do I 
  make a separate call to an accreditation service Maybe.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Spam dancers maybe let's we're going to find 
  out as as of ecosystem.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At the moment what we see is the technical 
  specs.
<ildiko_mazar> ...and the first (identifier) might be necessary 
  to verify the second (i.e. accredited status)
Dmitri Zagidulin:  These Registries they have an affordance they 
  have the feature that says.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here's the identity section here's the 
  accreditation section so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   They at least.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Give you the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of Hosting both in the same service.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But nothing is stopping you from using 2 
  different Services uh from that so it's unclear I suspect just 
  for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ality and developer convenience they might be 
  combined into 1 service so that instead of 2 HTP calls.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To choose different Services I make just 1 
  right but under the hood of putting together that registry of 
  course different um jurisdiction different uh authorities are 
  going to be.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Used to to combine that that information does 
  that make sense.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I so I completely agree with you and I suspect 
  we're going to see that everywhere that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some use cases and some verticals are going to 
  need the accreditation component and for others it's Overkill so 
  yes that exactly that uh what you said.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wearing our hat as technologists and uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Technical specification creators we need to 
  make sure that the specs that we use at least have that feature.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That at least you're able to provide that 
  accreditation information uh the other the other term for it the 
  other technical jargon for citation information uh that I've seen 
  is trust marks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Kind of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Terrible name right because it uses the very 
  loaded terminology of trust.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That we kind of want to so mentally translate 
  when you see trust marks in these uh specs think think of it as 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah other questions uh before we get into the 
  governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Got it um so governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Governance is hard so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This whole thing works.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I trust the entity providing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   The registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'm in a vertical.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where such trust trustworthy um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Authorities uh exist already whether it's 
  Mischief education whether it's Acro whether it's uh uh I'm Town 
  municipality whether it's a nonprofit that is hosting like here's 
  the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh what what.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Whether it's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Journalist that says here's the universities 
  or whatever that I've interviewed here they are and here's here's 
  their keys not that we expect really journalists to to do that 
  but I'm just giving an example that that could be really anyone.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What do we mean when we say by governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's identifying the The Entity who's hosting 
  the the registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What steps usually we want an explanation of 
  what was the procedure that they went through to kyc to know your 
  customer to to.
<ildiko_mazar> I suppose school rankings could be such lists too, 
  right?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ify the identity of the entries in there.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then what are the terms of service what's 
  the what's the liability what's the guarantee that that they're 
  taking on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right I Demetri could run.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A um registry service that says here's some 
  universities that Demitri talked to on the phone.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In the section under what's a liability none 
  use at your own risk right that's 1 end of the spectrum.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then on the other end of the spectrum is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh this is this list is run by Ministry of 
  Education uh here are the here's the procedures that we went 
  through for each University on there these are the forms that we 
  required uh we talked to I don't know the the registar on the 
  phone or on video uh these are the passports of the people 
  involved on file like as detailed and as as crazy as you want to 
  get.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So 1 of the social and Technical challenges 
  that we have is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Both as organizers of these Registries but 
  more more likely as consumers of the Registries as creators of 
  software or writers of policy.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We're going to need.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To figure this stuff out.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   At the moment.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Moment to the state of the art is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   There's a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Governance page there's a government's 
  document kind of like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A terms of service on any website or any 
  software that you install right the the thing that everybody 
  clicks through and and never looks at um because we know it's uh 
  it's opaque and hopeless anyways uh hopefully we can do slightly 
  better than that but.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Usually governance means a government's policy 
  document somewhere.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Will we ever get to a point where that 
  governance policy document is machine readable or machine 
  processable with or without Ai and llms maybe the moment.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We're hoping to just have human readable 
  documents that says uh this is such a so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What what are the reasons I'm mentioning it 
  is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Ultimately a human has to be in the loop.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The question is who and how often right we 
  want to set it up so that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Each individual user verifying a credential 
  doesn't need to be a uh policy expert.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so they they trust essentially they they 
  delegate the decision.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To the creator of the software of their 
  verification software they they trust that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Whichever registry the software is checking.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Good ones they did their due diligence now of 
  course we want to present the information um to the users as much 
  as possible so for example uh I'm going to talk about the trust 
  registry project in just a second but.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At the DCC the DCC wallet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Of the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Confidential 1 of the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Challenges that we're discussing right now and 
  making changes to your software is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay so each credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The issuer is checked against a number of 
  registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What's the best way of telling the user that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And at the moment what we're we're heading 
  towards is saying.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The the part that identifies the issuer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is the the part where it says MIT issued this 
  diploma.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That name is taken from a registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then we list which Registries were checked 
  so we can say.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   All right.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The issue appears to be mitt how do we know 
  because we checked the DCC issuer registry we checked the uh The 
  Edge you gain 1 the acro and the California Ministry of Education 
  or whatever.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Right we so we.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Surface to the user to the UI.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some of this information.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  With both the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The software so do you see creating the wallet 
  we maintain that list of of Registries that we were checking 
  right and and it's up to us to do our due diligence to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To read through the policy governance.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Documents for each 1 and say okay is this a 
  trustworthy.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Or or you know is this a useful registry for 
  us to check.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But in addition to our judgment as a software 
  vendors not vendors uh creators.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In addition we want to surface that 
  information to the user so that the user can double-check us to 
  say oh okay uh so this this registry.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh this is sure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is in the Ministry of Education registry okay 
  seems legit uh this issue is unknown.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and what do I do with that information or 
  this issuer is in Demitri's Fly by Night registry right I 
  exaggerated for a fact because if it is fly fly by night and not 
  that useful why is it in the list in the first place.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The the software creator.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Can see.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That it's useful but the user might not so 
  we're going to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This stage in the game we're going to try and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh let the user at least uh make their own 
  decisions but we we also understand that especially depending on 
  the vertical the user is not going to know some of these 
  authorities right like this is where government steps in this is 
  where legislation steps in this is where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Social contracts step in.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Other thing that I want to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That I want to highlight which is not obvious 
  is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In thinking about who can be trusted to run 
  these registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Especially for selfish credentials especially 
  for personal issue credential and what's an example of that a 
  resume a resume is uh I'm applying to a job.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I am making a number of claims about myself 
  issued by me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then it's up to the verifier the HR office 
  to uh double-check those claims but that's a that's a verifiable 
  credential and I'm going to sign with my own personal key.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That key that I put on my resume.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Is that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Going to be in any directory anywhere 
  unlikely.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Smart and diligent jurisdictions like the 
  European Union specifically forbid person level.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So what do we do in that case.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the answer is unclear the the field is is 
  trying to figure it out uh but 1 1 thing that I want to 
  highlight.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is that essentially we all already carry uh 
  direct our own personal trust Registries uh sorry issuer 
  Registries our own directories with us already in our mobile 
  phones in our address books.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's the difference between.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I get a call unknown number.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh unknown number but suspected as spam what 
  does that mean it means the software checked against uh a 
  registry provided by my cell phone carrier and said okay yeah 
  this is this is a good chance that it's spam or.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's uh Demetri's friend Joe that's calling oh 
  okay how do I know that because the phone checked an issue a 
  registry which happened to be my address book.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And we all know that um address books carry 
  phone numbers and emails uh but also there's a field there's 
  literally a field for key identifiers for account IDs in there so 
  what 1 thing that I want to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh sort of plant a seed and everybody's mind 
  is that especially for personal credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh while this whole infrastructure is booting 
  up don't forget about address books as a complimentary component 
  uh to these registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh we're nearing the top of the hour so let's 
  uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's make sure we cover a couple more.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If you're involved in building this technology 
  or writing spec uh writing policy.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_üá®üá¶> Levels of confidence useful 
  here, mapped to criteria IMO
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What are the specs what are the technical 
  specifications that describe how to run these Registries there's 
  a handful uh there's open ID federations uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sorry open ID foundations.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Federation 1.0 spec.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's the w3c uh ccg verifiable issues and 
  verifiers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's uh diffs that's the decentralized 
  identifiers Foundation.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh credential trust establishments back.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's many others.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh because there's there's all these um all 
  these specs.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Mit's digital credential Consortium credential 
  engine and a couple of other organizations uh got a got a fund uh 
  sorry got a grant to try and make sense of this to go through.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Some of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  These existing specifications and they're all 
  drafts because it's all it's all still early.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh to compare and contrast them figure out 
  what each 1 is trying to do.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and run a year-long pilot.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And of course share the learnings uh do 
  education Outreach so that's the issue registry project that that 
  I uh mentioned earlier so that's that's something my team 
  credential engine and others are are involved in.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And just to like spoiler we in we evaluated 
  all these specifications and I decided to go with open ID 
  Federation as our initial uh specification to implement.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   To learn.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  From and so on uh because we feel it's uh it's 
  very simple and it has the most sort of current momentum.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Of of.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of implementers that there's a bunch of uh 
  countries in Europe for example like Italy and Sweden Sweden that 
  have implemented it that that are that are experimenting with it 
  so we went with it as well.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But essentially all of these do the same thing 
  they they may have slightly different features and slightly uh 
  different.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Aspects to them but they're all either a flat 
  file mapping identifiers to entities or an API that says hey 
  what's a key 1 2 3 oh it's this entity here.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Or or in many cases uh both.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Encourage everyone to check out some of these 
  blog posts and and uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Mitts and credentials uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A research on the subject okay I heard a uh Q 
  sound so that's illico go ahead.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh great question what is vat.
<nate_otto> Value Added Tax
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh yeah I'm not I'm not familiar with that at 
  all uh I'm I'm not sure oh but probably that that's because they 
  already.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I I I think it's a government um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Government entity that has that mapping of 
  opaque identifiers your your vat number to who it is that it 
  represents yeah that's that's 1 natural authority to try and talk 
  to and say hey do do you want to stand behind this registry and 
  they might tell you that know for example in the US we have uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh much much maligned uh Social Security.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   I mean.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Administration that runs a directory of social 
  security numbers to like to People to kyc People.
<nate_otto> VAT registries are unlikely to include the DID 
  identifiers that we'd like to map to a registry entry, but that 
  authority could be extended to add support for these identifiers. 
  They have the org metadata, but they don't yet have the 
  credential issuance DIDs associated with these orgs.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That conversation came up with them in the US 
  government hey Social Security Administration.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Do you want to be do you want to run a 
  registry and they're like no we don't have the funds for it we 
  don't want to be responsible for it go away don't use our don't 
  don't use our identifiers for this stuff so.
<sharon_leu> Is someone working with Duns and Bradstreet?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They might say oh yeah this is this is a good 
  uh I don't know uh chance for us to get lots of um Government 
  funding yeah we'll we'll take that on or it'll be like no forget 
  it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and as um I think Nate points out in uh in 
  chat that they're unlikely to use.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At the moment they certainly don't have data 
  did information uh would they be interested in it uh unclear 
  probably not uh we have um also Ted on the Queue go ahead Ted.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh no worries.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Oh sorry 
  that's an accidental queue but um I was typing oh there we are 
  actually laws against using these social security number for any 
  purpose other than tracking Social Security and tax information 
  that's the only place it's allowed to be used and that's for 
  decades ago.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah yeah and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah so so and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In in recent like couple couple years ago or 
  or more recent like the for example Department of Homeland 
  Security came again to Social Security Administration is like hey 
  do you want to reconsider know we don't go away so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It'll depend uh Sharon in chat asks uh is 
  anybody working with duns and Bradstreet duns and Bradstreet the 
  the what is the DNB number uh is also a great example of such a 
  directory literally an opaque identifier like a random number uh 
  mapped to a known entity here's the interesting part about it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so so 1 are they going to be interested in 
  running such a thing I suspect so uh I haven't talked to them 
  personally they they might not be aware of uh this opportunity so 
  somebody should talk to them uh they're a great example because 
  they're a great example of why governance is important.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Would they be an actual fit for running such a 
  directory yes.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  However how useful such a directory uh it 
  depends on how much kyc they're willing to do behind each entry 
  what the liability and what the terms of service are.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To put it plainly.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I can I can get uh dunan uh DNB number.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Very easily without much documentation right I 
  can say hey I run this company here it is and get a number.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh a couple days later without without much 
  document so could I register uh a university with them or some 
  something equivalent yes.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> One other 
  Social Security note -- the *number* is not uniquely assigned; 
  the *combination of name and number* is uniquely assigned.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so it's 1 of those buyer beware things uh 
  if if they decide to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If they decide this is a business opportunity 
  and they're going to focus on it they they'll need to figure out 
  how much.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Identification they're going to do what their 
  terms of service are going to be how much liability they're going 
  to be right so like.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Pay attention to the fine print basically.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh oh Ted also points out Social Security it's 
  not that the numbers uniquely assigned it's specifically the 
  combination of name and number that is unique that's interesting 
  I did not know that that's cool tidbit all right uh other other 
  questions.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  As we near the top of the hour.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So let's let's summarize.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  5 F credentials we need registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   In order.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Order to make any any of this work specially 
  in open world scenarios what do I mean by that well for example 
  in um the true age.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Age verification project IT issues verifiable 
  credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Does it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  A uh issue a registry behind it no because 
  there's only 1 issuer.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Which is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The North American Association of convenience 
  stores.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Like we're going to issue the credentials and 
  that's it so the verifier software.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All we need to know about 1 is her except they 
  too rotate keys so it's really it's not even just 1 key ID that 
  they need that the verifier needs to know about it's the history 
  of the keys but still.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They can they can go to uh uh hard-coded place 
  on uh the next website and then download the key history and work 
  like that so they don't need necessarily a full-on issue register 
  but that's because it's a very narrow sort of closed world use 
  case where there's only 1 issue or and a bunch of verifiers and 
  they can coordinate the moment you have multiple issuers like 
  with education universities that's where you need these 
  Registries that's why we need this information.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the tech behind it is easy go look at the 
  specs the governance is hard as usual nothing we can do about it 
  uh buyer beware and read the fee print.
<sharon_leu> Thanks for this great overview!
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I'll just check for last moment questions uh 
  thank you everyone uh talk to you all uh if not next week uh 
  because I think a number of us are going to be at IBEW then 
  definitely the week after and thanks Sharon.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Bye everyone.

[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Discussion follows.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: Discussing these concepts for awhile, and these are the concepts. Does anyone need a quick reminder overview of these concepts. I will take silence as good. Does anyone want to add a concept?
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: Let's go and dive into descriptions and let's go one by one. It currently reads an activity. An activity describes something. So and activity describes something someone has done, conducted a mooc, ..., spent 6 years working as a lion trainer, I love our examples. Does everyone agree with this activity. Let's start with

[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: the extent seems to be an involvement. this is someone who has spent 6 years being a lion tamer, but is no
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: the idea is to plan current enrollment or current activity or so on. I don't think the high level concept. When we go to describe what is in an activity... activity can contain sub activity....
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: if I want to describe what a lion tamer has done during those years, I don't think I should limit.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	kezike: during a lion tamer you can acquire activities, you can also be involve, you can terminate but you can still have the activity credentials you've acquired...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: I would argue that key ... it depends on how we model,, the activity is tied to verbs...you worked as a lion tamer...you are student...you are a member of the association...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: I am trying to keep this at a high level, if we are going to think about distintiction.... I wonder if involvement....involvment more about describing role than activity.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: having opened this ... career as a lion tamer as something that someone ... a role or
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: That's a key thing, thinking about circumstances ... person involved in it now, or is someow past. A classic, is I am student, currently in, or is it something I took 4 years ago.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: activity doesn't neccessarily have an expiration date.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: I have been comments about expiration... make sure it is still there....dump at the bottom page. invovlement describes current and future role in organization.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: what is the...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: thinking ...is  (???)
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: that makes a lot more sense
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: something someone has a result of participating. my only comment is compentancy is a certain set of word. hundreds of ... the only one I am asking is can we be okay with competancy and forever hold out piece. In that case are we okay with, I also typing as we write. can one add an info block of activity.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: I am a little bit uncomfortable that competancy may arise from an activity that may be defined. Compentency ...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: can you type
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Keith: wouldn't it be easier to start with terms from credential engine... apprentinceship
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	StuartSutton: apprenticeship can be
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: these ... would you consider earning a participation badge a competancy....
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: I would consider the ability to run a marathon to be a competancy. run the marathon 30 years ago or last week. earning the badge is a recognition type.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: I would agree that I would not consider them competncies.... we understnad that there may be many definitions...we
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: this bucket
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: reaching a certain level of achievement ... we need competanct recognition as certain copetancey or skill ... this seems very logical skill
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: someone say to look a comptetancy from a ce defition...I suppose tht could be put at the bottom as part of the parking lot notes.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: be the same defintion pretty wall..
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: copy and paste..
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: would be happy updating the entire ctdl defition, but I will leave that
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: (don't know about the us) arguing about outcome vs. skill, but I agree that both keeps everyone happy
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: comment now and then we will ..
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: and then this leaves us with recognition type.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: okay this is , this is the point where according to the rules of this meeting I have to leave you, and then kimhd will come...all we have left is subject and issuer... this will work quite elegantly I hope
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Franki: looking at the term profiency...we were trying to use profiency term, I have a particular outcome, bachelors of engineering doesn't mean I am at the same level as my peers
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: sounds like a profiency is a bit closer to competancy... not necessary to put proficiency in recognition type...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: it is 15 minutes left, they seem to be going well. they seem to be deep in debate
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Franki: additional comment as a data person, and not as someone with a background in education, at least as we do an electonic learning record, someone audited a class and then they come bakc later and take the exams
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Franki: go back...which one leads to the grrested profiency
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	ottonomy: take out of definition, because these are high level concepts. don't want to deal with this at this point.
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: what might go int oa defintion type or competancy....not say ... lower level than high level?
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: same thing, type at the bottom so we don't lose it... I would super appreciate it...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: subject and issuer. subject is the clearest possible so if you agree we ... the subject of the ... is the subject of the credentials.... guardianship...
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: come to issuer. we are not going. we need to make sure that the issuer describes the organization... varying from the 23c defition. making claims about the subject. the issuer signing the credential is not neccasrily the person who ...sorry mental block ...the organization who is making the claim about the student...IT ...signing the crednail...  issuer the organization issuring the credential (not it they don't know anything) ... would be
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	keith_kowal: would be problematic to move awat from the2 w3c defintion... I think we have that with the signer. the issuer is the one who
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	kimhd: we were right at the good stuff and we wanted to power through... we introduced the idea that name is actually required.. the other key part is we made progress on multiple issuers. you can create emergent with multiple issuer. then we defined with custom joined issuer types. if you see this type...relying would see multiple sig...trust uiver a or royal college of B...if they want to do both...we just say expect an array of signatures.. nothing: essentially finished 6 concepts...put more work on distinguishing work vs involvement...competancy as stayed same.... recognition type now particular level of achievement.... employment, actucuty biw someonething someone has done. involvement now role. recogition type... defintion type now ...formal recognition type... sibject we didn't touch ... issuer orgnanziat
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	Phil-T3: should it be called recognition, think about possible types..recognition on its own should be
[2021-03-16T16:00:00.000Z]	<kimhd>	AnthonyFCamilleri: then we will try it for recognition alone... basiclaly is the next meeting is we should adopt the PR.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-166').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-166').show()" id="166" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Yeah so so there are 3 classes of challenges there um almost all of the challenges have to do with like um so with with the QR code the challenge is always like the size of the QR code you want to keep it really small which means you&apos;re verifiable credential needs to come in somewhere between 300 to 500 bytes if you want to fit it on like 1 of these ID cards um which is not a lot of space right especially when the digital signature takes up like 64 bytes and the and the and the you know the the did key or whatever takes up another like 32 bytes half your payload is already gone in like signature and key key key values um uh. <a id="link-166" style="display:none;" href="#166">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-167').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-167').show()" id="167" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So so size is really important for QR codes and for NFC because NFC it&apos;s like you can only transmit 1,000 bytes a second and while that sounds like a non it it sounds like a lot it really is not so you&apos;re looking at like 1500 bytes if you&apos;re doing it over NFC you&apos;ll probably top out about 2 kilobytes 2,000 bytes is um for you know for the types of interactions that most people are are used to um and then for Bluetooth there&apos;s a good chance that your other device doesn&apos;t have Bluetooth on it so if you&apos;re doing like phone to phone maybe it has it or maybe the person on the other side forgot to turn their Bluetooth on in in their fumbling around with their phone trying to turn the Bluetooth on um uh you know maybe there&apos;s a mismatch in in Bluetooth protocols you know all kinds of bad things happen with Bluetooth but if you can get up to a Bluetooth connection then you can send like megabytes you know no problem. <a id="link-167" style="display:none;" href="#167">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-168').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-168').show()" id="168" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The what we found is the challenge is kind of like up uh up upgrading in in protocol so if you like go from NFC to Bluetooth we&apos;ve seen some you know interactions with like mdl where they&apos;re like you know SC the QR code or tap the phone and then they&apos;ll need to like interact with their phone all over again to like actually transmit the credential whereas with NFC like people are very trained to just tap and go right with payments it&apos;s like take your credit card tap it to the terminal um if you&apos;re on you know have a metro Subway card you take it you tap it to the the reader to open the gate um people are not used to like tapping their phone and then looking at the screen and having to make a whole bunch of like you know selections and then you know the Bluetooth thing um going over so um there is a usability challenge as well um when you bring Bluetooth into the mix um but sometimes you like you. <a id="link-168" style="display:none;" href="#168">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-170').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-170').show()" id="170" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Don&apos;t have an option like when we when we go to post-quantum cryptography it&apos;s going to have to almost certainly happen over over Bluetooth because of the signature sizes um. <a id="link-170" style="display:none;" href="#170">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-171').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-171').show()" id="171" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The other thing I didn&apos;t mention didn&apos;t didn&apos;t focus on quite here is like there is a huge education credential part of what we&apos;re doing here right the first thing is knowing whether or not the person&apos;s a first responder but then you need to kind of what they really want is to understand the First Responders skill set so they&apos;re like you know so they know if this firefighter is trained to fight a certain type of chemical fire or if this EMT is capable of operating in a neonatal field unit right um so knowing what who&apos;s showing up and what skill set they&apos;re bringing to the disaster to help um is vital because sometimes it can take like hours upon hours to figure out what everyone&apos;s capable of and that means that you know people that are in in danger are put in more danger because they can&apos;t be pulled out by the by the right people showing up um sooner than later. <a id="link-171" style="display:none;" href="#171">✪</a></div>

[2025-02-18T17:05:25.544Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That maximize um individual Agency on the web I think it's really important uh to build out a web um based on those principles uh as always wonderful to be here.
[2025-02-18T17:05:29.303Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Uh thank you man and thanks for sending the example so if you.

[2025-02-18T17:08:22.063Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah just a quick update on the standards track stuff at w3c so the verifiable credential working group um is getting ready to prepare the final uh proposed recommendations for I think it's like 8 specifications simultaneously now it's verifiable credentials 20 data Integrity uh the ecdsa eddsa crypto Suites bit string status list Json uh verifiable credential Json schema uh VC huzzy cozy.
[2025-02-18T17:08:34.447Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Here's another 1 the a controlled uh identifiers specification 8 specifications never been part of a working group that has ever tried to take that many specifications.
[2025-02-18T17:08:43.503Z]	<econnell>	present+
[2025-02-18T17:09:35.252Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: At the same time but the verifiable credential working group is is doing that um we are expecting that to happen in a month um so just a heads up to everyone um that is the last step to the global standardization um uh uh uh track um uh what happens when we put stuff in proposed recommendation is we're proposing it to the worldwide Web Consortium membership that it should be published as a global standard so all 8 of those documents should become Global standards and then the w3c membership who has been tracking this you know the whole while um gets to have a final vote on whether or not they allow it uh this is the last chance kind of people have to formally object against the work um uh before it becomes a global standard uh we have no signals that anyone's planning to formally object it's it's highly uh frowned upon at this stage because it's been you know in development for.
[2025-02-18T17:09:35.879Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  uh 3.
[2025-02-18T17:09:43.794Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
[2025-02-18T17:09:53.077Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That is what we're getting ready to do just a heads up to everyone you know again feel free to take a read through the specifications um if you find any grammatical errors or anything of that nature you know let us know um but we're on a good track.
[2025-02-18T17:09:53.348Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  that's it.
[2025-02-18T17:09:58.552Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Oh sorry that was that was verifiable credentials the other thing that's happening is um.
[2025-02-18T17:10:48.139Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh Marcus and Jonathan and the chairs uh of the did methods uh working group at uh deaf are doing a great job trying to figure out you know what the first set of did methods are that we're going to standardize um in parallel we're going to be putting a charter forward uh at w3c for those did method um for that did method working group um so that is uh proceeding as well uh those meetings happen uh every other Thursday um really good good energy in that group lots of people showing up usually about 18 plus people showing up um which is a good healthy amount of of input into that process uh that's it as far as updates there are concerned.
[2025-02-18T17:10:49.201Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thank you thanks Mom you.
[2025-02-18T17:10:53.120Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Any other uh announcements or reminders.
[2025-02-18T17:11:06.622Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right um what items updates uh any updates on the work items.
[2025-02-18T17:12:11.546Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Sorry um there's a new meeting that we're rolling into the work item um uh meetings uh per week uh that's around data Integrity uh there are a number of people uh are good colleagues in Europe and um uh Italy specifically uh well Netherlands and and and Switzerland too I guess um that are um uh working on uh post-quantum crypto Suites um we've got our colleagues in Singapore uh in Asia Pacific region working on um uh uh selective redaction uh crypto Suites um and we of course continue to work on the final bits of the BBS crypto Suites uh for privacy preserving unlabel disclosure uh we're going to have to start we're we've had we've been the editors have been having meetings for the past.
[2025-02-18T17:12:12.098Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  past 2 years.
[2025-02-18T17:12:37.237Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The VC working group but we're opening up to the the next kind of stage of crypto Suites that we're planning to take standards track uh at w3c those meetings will be uh on Fridays at 10:00 a.m. uh Eastern to try and make it work for our you know uh European colleagues as well as uh folks on the west coast um uh.
[2025-02-18T17:13:00.907Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So that that announcement that that meeting invite went out to the ccg mailing list earlier today so if you're interested in advanced cryptography and digital signatures and privacy preserving unlabel um digital signatures and things like that uh please join us um we're going to be working on kind of some of the Next Generation uh stuff.
[2025-02-18T17:13:20.077Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thank you man and by the way uh we will have uh Andrea and Jeremy uh Jeremy uh actually here a month from now on March 18th to talk about multi-key multibase verifiable credentials and pqc uh post Quantum cryptography verifiable credentials so.
[2025-02-18T17:13:51.139Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: And uh uh so on March 11th uh basically 3 weeks from now we will have the quarter 1 2025 review and work item update so I send out uh presentation deck uh to different um project leads uh so please help like uh update the presentation deck um so that we can kind of go through these work item updates um March 11th.
[2025-02-18T17:13:51.793Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: By the way I.
[2025-02-18T17:14:10.681Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: I I had the opportunity to kind of represent us uh in the security industry associations uh webinar to talk about the wcm ccg work items so actually having a quarterly review of these work items and updates is uh actually quite helpful.
[2025-02-18T17:14:22.285Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: It took me like probably an hour just to put it together because everything's there so thank you thanks everyone for actually uh updating these work items and uh actually contributing to them.
[2025-02-18T17:14:35.587Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right um last calls for introductions reintroductions um announcements reminders or what guidelines related stuff.
[2025-02-18T17:14:54.947Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: All right let's schedule the main agenda so again we're very excited to have M here to actually talk about verifiable credentials for First Responders so money uh the floor is yours.
[2025-02-18T17:14:57.689Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	Topic: <Verifiable Credentials for First Responders>
[2025-02-18T17:14:59.220Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Awesome thanks Harrison let me go ahead and screen share.
[2025-02-18T17:16:00.931Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: All right um let me know if folks can't see this but I think you can um okay so uh this uh particular presentation is about um the first responder committee uh and using verifiable credentials um in in that Community um so uh these folks are called different things throughout uh the the world but you know First Responders are typically people like uh firefighters um uh uh emergency medical technicians um uh police um that come into an area when a disaster happens um and they help people right they they they they help people that need to go to the hospital they help people that may be injured or immobilized they rescue people from buildings or flooding or fires um these are you know people that um uh help us in our greatest times.
[2025-02-18T17:17:01.519Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh of need um people also don't quite realize that you know First Response goes beyond just that just firefighters and police and and EMTs um there are all kinds of other people that come in to um uh uh an area um when a disaster happens so for example like civil engineers come in to check to make sure the buildings are safe to be reoccupied um uh the US uh de comes in like because uh following a flood there can be outbreaks of disease um CDC so all of these people are kind of a part of the response effort um as well as people in your local community I mean people that um you know are typically in a an accountant or a local shop owner um sometimes are also uh a volunteer and Disaster Response um person um so when we talk about verifiable credentials for First Responders we're talking about verifiable credential usage among all of these people.
[2025-02-18T17:17:08.688Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Victims themselves the people that have been caught up in a um in a in a bad situation um.
[2025-02-18T17:18:09.835Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So uh let me kind of use uh and an example that's fairly uh um uh fresh and I know some of you you know um directly experienced this or were very close to it um um uh to kind of you know kick off what we're going to to talk about today so I'm going to talk about kind of the problem and vision using a very specific example um we'll look at what some of these verifiable credentials look like they look slightly different than the ones that we've typically uh are used to will highlight the technologies that this community is actively uh working on to help the first responder community and then we can talk about kind of next steps where it's this stuff going um you know when when can we expect to see it um uh uh uh used um okay so I'm sure many of you have seen this picture this is from the recent California wildfires um and it shows you how incredible.
[2025-02-18T17:18:10.552Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  incredibly scary.
[2025-02-18T17:19:11.266Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: You know these these events can be um uh this is um uh you know a picture right in the middle of when the fires were coming through the things that you know made the fires so damaging is incredibly high winds you know really dry environment um you know and fire all of those things together made it 1 of uh the the more devastating um uh uh disasters that that California has experienced um so when when events like this happen and we had a couple of these types of events happened last year there was a hurricane Milton hurricane Helen on the east coast in the United States on the west coast we had the wildfires and clearly all around the world there were other other things mudslides flooding um things of that nature each 1 of them uh a disaster with uh First Responders responding within hours uh to try and help uh the local population.
[2025-02-18T17:19:28.753Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	present+
[2025-02-18T17:19:46.216Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So this is typically what it looks like right right after the first uh you know right after the disaster starts or um strikes or even leading up to it like a hurricane you know it's going to happen and you kind of know where it's going to go even with wildfires that you know you can't predict you know 5 days ahead of where things are going to be but usually our to our you've got kind of a prediction on where things you know might go based on wind and weather and things like that um and so the people that show up to um.
[2025-02-18T17:20:46.668Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: I help uh rescue people and to help in the recovery efforts um are are these these folks that you see on the screen right um and they have just driven in from all types of different locations um uh in the United States uh as we know uh you know our um uh our our friends to the north of the border of the Canadians uh in in South of the Border in Mexico came into battle the the California wildfires so you have this very decentralized response to um a local uh typically a local um emergency of some kind and 1 of the things you know that's wonderful about this this this system is it is fantastically decentralized when when you see you know when when the First Responders see something happening they've already got plans on on who's going to to be deployed generally but when you when you look at the people in this picture.
[2025-02-18T17:21:12.652Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Each 1 of them has like a totally different Mission profile um totally different batching system totally different identification system uh and they all come together um and this person in the middle is usually the the the resource officer of the coordinator and they're the 1 that's supposed to know who showed up what they're capable of doing and where they can be most effectively uh uh deployed um.
[2025-02-18T17:21:33.595Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: These things are chaotic in nature right they're they're they're chaotic in nature um and so sometimes things don't always go right or you know despite everyone's best efforts you know people get in that shouldn't get in so here's an example.
[2025-02-18T17:21:46.066Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Something that just happened in the LA fires so it turns out and you can read the read the thing on the the right there was a convicted arsonist in Oregon um and his wife.
[2025-02-18T17:22:47.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Bought a fire truck and drove into the LA evacuation area and got through because they were in a firetruck they were dressed as firefighters they had badges that that look legitimate and because everything so decentralized you know there's no way to really check you know their ID um in in in you know every large scale incident has a number of stories just like this um uh disasters attract a certain type of Personality sometimes that really shouldn't be there whether it's to loot the houses that people have evacuated or set additional fires uh because you know everyone's evacuated and no 1's supposed to be around arsonists kind of gravitate to um these these sites um in in this is all happening while the First Responders are doing their best to try and keep people safe keep.
[2025-02-18T17:22:47.975Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  people that should.
[2025-02-18T17:22:48.173Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Be in the area.
[2025-02-18T17:23:09.731Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	present+
[2025-02-18T17:23:15.504Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Of the area and so there's a lot of kind of Incident Management um uh that has to happen that make sure that people are really well known to get behind um the the line that's that's being protected right so this is what happens 1 of the things that happens when you've got a decentralized system and you don't have very good identity uh management controls around that um around that system.
[2025-02-18T17:24:16.215Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Okay so what's the mission here um or or rather you know what's what's the problem the problem here is people can buy fake uniforms and they often do uh they fake their IDs um their templates online that you can use to to print out um uh you know uh fire response EMT cards you know things of that nature fake Hospital badges um and it's really difficult for these incident commanders the people that are in charge of of managing the incident and um uh you know uh according off the area so that it can be recovered it's really difficult for them to get a big picture view of of what's going on um uh especially a verified responders to a large-scale incident um you know we've we've been out to some of these locations in in in many of these cases the thing that the dashboard that they have to manage their First Responders is a whiteboard it is a physical whiteboard and people come in and they stick their.
[2025-02-18T17:24:27.493Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: There um tear offs onto the onto the the Whiteboard and that's how they know who's on site and who's assigned to what and and whether somebody came back.
[2025-02-18T17:25:28.363Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh an area or not right at the end of the day if their badges still there then they know they need to go out and potentially rescue um that that uh responder uh and the bigger the incident the bigger the Whiteboard that is that is how we operate you know today there is some digitization that that happens um and there are many processes and procedures in place that make these operations run smoothly the vast majority of the time but when you have a large scale incident like the LA wildfires uh like uh hurricane Milton or hurricane H Helen inevitably it is very difficult to to understand who's who and who should be there and and who shouldn't be there uh and more importantly where to where to deploy the people so the vision here is to deploy the right people with the right training to the right location at the right time getting all 4 of those things done uh is is still difficult.
[2025-02-18T17:25:39.190Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Um and the other thing is to ensure that the that we're able to rapidly and accurately secure the perimeter perimeter around these um disaster um.
[2025-02-18T17:25:41.650Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh uh areas.
[2025-02-18T17:26:01.741Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh there are challenges in doing this right so I mean like you know what we do in this community is like you know digital credentials we we you know believe in high security High cryptography you know we presume people have like mobile devices and digital wallets and like it's the wonderful future right but but in.
[2025-02-18T17:26:02.156Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  a first.
[2025-02-18T17:26:39.379Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Scenario they're working in a very different environment than the 1 that we're designing for or have traditionally designed for in the ccg so some of the challenges here are that powers down right after a hurricane after uh you know a wildfire there's no power um and there might not be power for weeks and then if it comes on it might be intermittent you know that sort of thing uh networks go down like quite literally mobile network you know a cell towers burned to the ground or knocked down you know backups go down um and so and when they come back on they're they're usually kind of.
[2025-02-18T17:27:23.448Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Dated um uh with with too much traffic and then they can go down as well uh clearly not everyone has a mobile digital wallet people lose their phones in disasters or they get stepped on crushed run out of battery a variety of different you know negative things there um and these environments are dirty right it's it's raining it's muddy there's you know wildfires it's just not a clean operating um environment um the other challenge um which I which I mentioned is that um there are many jurisdictions that respond right I mean if if you look at you know who responds to like like if we look at the the California wildfires.
[2025-02-18T17:28:18.158Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The people responding might be a very big ladder company out of out of like you know San Francisco Cisco or or San Diego or it might be a 4-person volunteer fire department that's driven 3 states to to be there right so it's a very decentralized kind of um uh uh response effort uh and so this system by Design okay and it's a good design is inherently decentralized because if you have any kind of centralization in in a emergency response system there's a chance that that point of centralization goes down and causes the response to fail right that's that's what that's what we don't don't want to see uh happen um so it's inherently a decentralized system um and and that is 1 of the reasons where applying decentralized Technologies uh to this decentralized system so.
[2025-02-18T17:28:29.094Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
[2025-02-18T17:28:30.638Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: What are where are we starting actually let me let me stop here are there any kind of questions around like the problems the vision what we're trying to do here the challenge is.
[2025-02-18T17:28:34.635Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Before I go into kind of what we're trying right now.
[2025-02-18T17:29:10.269Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: No I don't think there's anyone in the queue but I do want to uh add a comment uh is that there's actually a a business opportunity too right we're in the business side a little bit uh there's a company called merits um actually they specializing this space uh emergency respond um like basically digital credentials for uh emergency responses so it's actually a uh business wise it's actually um there's actually a sizable Market in this market.
[2025-02-18T17:29:13.180Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Swami comment there.
[2025-02-18T17:29:21.395Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	https://www.merits.com/industries/emergency-services.html
[2025-02-18T17:30:04.086Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yes plus 1 to that I I I failed to mention that this this program that we're working on is funded by uh the by DHS the US Department of Homeland Security as a part of their emergency response efforts um FEMA is also you know uh 1 of the 1 of the organizations that that's really interested in this and US Department of Homeland Security is the is the federal you know agency that is trying to get the the way we respond to large-scale disasters um more standardized right not centralized but standardized so that when all these people show up onto a site they um they can identify themselves more strongly um in DHS has funded uh you know work um in this area and it's it's not a new thing right they've been funding this for 20.
[2025-02-18T17:30:14.543Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: For 20 plus years like a long time um because they because they knew that you know they know that you know large-scale disasters are still.
[2025-02-18T17:30:15.367Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: They want to.
[2025-02-18T17:30:22.024Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: They want to help things you know help help responders get to where they need to you know much faster um.
[2025-02-18T17:31:24.254Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh okay so what are we focusing on we're we're focusing on something super simple to to start and that is the ID badges for these First Responders so First Responders have ID badges uh and if you're a volunteer fire department in the middle of you know the the Midwest in your population of your town is you know like 300 people um you're going to print your bad badge off on an inkjet printer and you might laminate it maybe you'll laminate it right so that's kind of and and you have no budget at all right it's like everything's volunteer you know everything's donation-based so but but those responders you know we have to make sure that they are capable of responding and they have the same kind of technology that someone in for example you know Dallas or Chicago or San Francisco or New York City would have so the we have to pick a solution that is.
[2025-02-18T17:31:25.442Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Incredibly cost effective.
[2025-02-18T17:31:30.517Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Across the entire uh United States um.
[2025-02-18T17:31:30.718Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  so this.
[2025-02-18T17:32:31.197Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: This is what 1 of the badges look like I had to redact a bunch of information on it but um that QR code that you see on the left there is a verifiable credential so I think many of you have seen that you know we've been able to uh greatly compress a verifiable credentials down into something that will fit into a QR code with a digital signature on it um that that thing that that you know pattern of static that you see that QR code is a 100% legitimate w3c verifiable credential and we'll go into how we how we get it that small uh to to fit onto the card um so the thing on the left is the physical badge that uh we're giving these um a First Responders and then the thing on the right is just a website that can be used to verify the badge no matter where you are um um that website uh in the future you know will be fully offline capable so that even if the Network's down.
[2025-02-18T17:33:20.340Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh you can um uh verify the badge um in totally open to anyone that needs to verify 1 of these bads badges so it's open to Citizens that need to verify if a first responder is actually who they say they are before they come into their neighborhood or their home um it allows um law enforcement to enforce uh checkpoints in a disaster Zone by being able to scan the badge uh again you know we're looking for incredibly uh cost-effective solutions that work on what people have today so First Responders have badge printing systems so it's either an inkjet printer and they laminate it or they have more sophisticated like uh plastic badge you know printing uh uh systems um.
[2025-02-18T17:33:22.635Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: And so we needed a solution.
[2025-02-18T17:33:40.194Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That worked for those modalities so no digital wallet know you know online infrastructure none of that it's got to work fully offline um uh and and be able to be put onto a tiny you know ID card okay.
[2025-02-18T17:33:51.406Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q+
[2025-02-18T17:34:13.284Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That's the first thing that we're we're deploying is is these physical credentials for First Responders and it up it UPS their ability to more strongly identify it allows The Incident Commander to more strongly identify uh who the individual is and even sometimes their level of training like there are multiple levels of like EMT like you can be a EMT or an advanced EMT or paramedic in each 1 of those levels says that you can do uh more uh than than the than the other level that went before you so.
[2025-02-18T17:34:27.031Z]	<Will_Abramson>	present+
[2025-02-18T17:35:13.919Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So Physical badges QR codes that's 1 of the things we're doing and of course um you know we're using technology that this group uh has incubated over many years to do it so we're using w3c verifiable credentials 20 uh we have this this vocabulary called the first responder vocabulary that we've we've published so I'll you know pull this up and this vocabulary here if I can let's see if I can uh zoom in the first responder vocabulary has all these different things like we can talk about individual skills the training that they have um uh uh the role that the individual has um there are a bunch of nist uh and fips conformance things that we can encode in the badge um and fundamentally if we go down to like you know 1 of the examples like this is what a first.
[2025-02-18T17:35:14.965Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Edge looks like.
[2025-02-18T17:35:44.258Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: As a verifiable credential right so this is just Samantha doe in Samantha's first responder badge she's an EMT out of Georgia um she's been deployed you know for 105 days so you have some idea of how much experience she has she's attached to Grady Memorial Hospital um she's got you know this identifier and again dating Integrity proof so so again 100% you know w3c verifiable credential.
[2025-02-18T17:35:50.695Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh using the the the first responder vocabulary there.
[2025-02-18T17:35:52.772Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2025-02-18T17:35:55.642Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Um the other let's see uh.
[2025-02-18T17:36:22.206Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Other thing that we're doing is we're using the data Integrity crypto Suite that this group's worked on we're using core LD to get the compression um uh to the the part that we need and we're using some of the verifiable credential barcodes specification that we uh talked about earlier this year and adopted work item here so this this set of Technologies is what we're using uh for the first responder um uh credentials.
[2025-02-18T17:37:03.814Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So that's those are the physical credentials um we are also um working on digital credentials as well of course um and this is what uh an emergency medical technician badge looks like um in a digital wallet today um uh you'll see a tap to share icon here we'll talk about that here in a bit but down at the bottom we're using some of the render method stuff to get it to render uh in a nice way so this is Samantha Do's ID card what it looks like um it's digitally signed you know over again uh w3c verifiable credential um.
[2025-02-18T17:37:54.355Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: And we've got a little tap to share button here that will share it over NFC so we've got Wireless transmission of uh this uh EMT card in case the network is totally down and they need to do a peer-to-peer verification on the right hand side this is the NFC verifier um this particular credential I think we have down to like 1.5 kilobytes and that includes the picture um uh in there um uh and over NFC it takes about 1 and a half seconds to transmit and verify the the whole thing so we can shove it all down into a very simple tap to ID um uh credential in theory we can support you know selective disclosure on linkable disclosure all those different variations um uh.
[2025-02-18T17:38:48.477Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That is out there you can actually I think yeah we we still need to release the the verifier side of it for for the NFC but this badge you can pick up in the VC playground uh today uh and you'd have the tap to share uh capability and the and the display capability um so what are we using for the digital version of this stuff again no surprise here w3c verifiable credentials 20 first responder vocabulary core LD to get the payload down really tiny uh so that we can send it over NFC and we're using the verifiable credentials over Wireless um uh specification uh which we keep intending to move over to the ccg we just haven't done it quite yet um so if anyone's interested in in working with us on the wireless spec we'd love to love to chat with you and get some other company names uh on the specification.
[2025-02-18T17:38:48.804Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q+ to ask about offline aspects of this
[2025-02-18T17:39:11.809Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Okay so that's uh that's the digital uh version of it and this is what it looks like I think this 1 is transmitting and uh employment authorization document so I'll just hit play the thing on the left is 1 of the digital wallets and the thing on the right is the verifier that can be built into a digital wallet so and it happens pretty quickly go ahead and hit play.
[2025-02-18T17:39:15.251Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So what they're doing is.
[2025-02-18T17:39:18.246Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Pulling it up clicking tap to share.
[2025-02-18T17:39:47.317Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Up the other phone uh tapping it on the back and that's it it's verified on the right and you can see the debugging information the verifiable credential um you know passed over uh that I'll show it once again because that usually that went pretty quickly um again this is the digital wallet on the left here it's a web-based digital wallet it's not a native app you click tap to share um the thing on the right is a native app.
[2025-02-18T17:39:57.234Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: And it reads and verifies and a very small amount of time uh totally offline um uh mechanism at play there.
[2025-02-18T17:40:06.235Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Uh it doesn't use Bluetooth or anything like that it's just a straight NFC uh tap to verify um example um okay.
[2025-02-18T17:40:21.263Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So uh what is uh well there we go so what's next and this is the last slide um uh currently we're deploying this in Pilots across the United States so this is not just like.
[2025-02-18T17:41:22.010Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Look at this cool you know lab demo now we're deploying it in um um uh in Pilots uh across in multiple different states the other thing that's really interesting about this space is like every state there the way they run their Emergency Response Group is different like they're run by the states they have different requirements you know in in each state is some of that a good thing some of it's a bad thing right interrupts really hard um uh we are expecting production deployments of this stuff um very soon now unfortunately I can't I can't say how soon but it's it's this year um uh soon um and then you know what can we do in this group to kind of help move this stuff along well you know we're using a number of things um to make this real uh verifiable credential API is critical for issuance and transmission um of the uh credentials uh we're using core LD which is.
[2025-02-18T17:42:22.535Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Going to go standards track um uh in the in the Json LDC board LD working group so that Charters pretty much there and and reviewed um close to close to making progress there maybe Benjamin you can speak more to that in a bit um we had the verifiable credentials barcodes thing which is important for those QR codes and to be able to compress the verifiable credentials a small enough to fit in these QR codes and and barcodes and then finally the verifiable credentials over Wireless specification to move things over NFC uh and then for larger uh credentials uh over uh Bluetooth um so those are the things that we're hoping to move into the verifiable credential working group over the next um uh after we get the current set of of those 8 specifications uh done um and then once we do that we expect a a little more rapid turnaround on these specifications because they've been incubated for so long um in the.
[2025-02-18T17:42:23.132Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  in the C.
[2025-02-18T17:42:39.000Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: All right I mean that's pretty much it um happy to chat about anything the group wants to with respect to kind of what we're doing here um so we can probably you know go to the queue if people have any questions.
[2025-02-18T17:42:55.016Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Well thank you Mano uh wonderful uh as usual uh really excited about this project I've got just a couple of uh questions about the offline aspect uh.
[2025-02-18T17:42:57.704Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	ack dmitri
[2025-02-18T17:43:28.656Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Question about dids and did key uh question about QR codes and about the NFC I'll start in reverse order uh what's so we know there's a 4 4000 bites roughly limit on QR codes uh the singular ones uh I know um visualizar team has some really cool tech for um what are they called like moving QR codes that I can stuff more uh is what's the size limit for the NFC table.
[2025-02-18T17:44:28.863Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Um so the size limit is how long you want to wait with both phones together right so you could you could transmit so the the typical the typical speeds that we've found in let let me kind of back up and and talk about like what we're what technology stack we're trying to use we're trying to Target pure whatever's in the web browser pure web browser engagement right because we want maximum we want people's Maxim maximize people's ability to move these things around and that means use the web um uh typically because an app install is like a point of friction and what we're finding of course is that people are like I don't want to install an app so we're like okay but can you go to a website like are you willing to go to the website and if they're willing to go to a website then we can do the the NFC thing so so typically the the speeds we've found through the browsers is around 1 kilobyte a second that's what you can transfer and if you if you make that transfer take longer than like a 7.
[2025-02-18T17:44:29.881Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  second and a half.
[2025-02-18T17:44:53.992Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Is that the individual will pull the phone away before the transmission's done goes up like exponentially so we're we're you know yes you can transmit 4 kilobytes but do people have the patient to hold their phones still for 4 seconds now like the our our that's what we found like people are like they they get antc after about a second and a half yeah.
[2025-02-18T17:44:59.329Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh that makes perfect sense that be and and I bet the the visual feedback is like we don't have a loading bar or anything affords.
[2025-02-18T17:45:01.177Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Exactly yeah that's the other real big problem.
[2025-02-18T17:45:04.474Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: So so to that end um.
[2025-02-18T17:45:38.669Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I guess my main question is in the pictures right because so much of this offline uh first respond to credential depends on the picture for the Biometrics and pictures of the notoriously big right what uh what are the challenges that you found and and what what are you thinking of how do we stuff in pictures into uh you know not even 1 or 2K let alone 4K I I I know some of uh my own experimentations with the core LD it's like it's rough the the logos are very small uh to fit into a QR code.
[2025-02-18T17:46:04.776Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Mhm yeah you're exactly right and and I unfortunately I don't so so we've got some QR codes where we do fit in pictures where it's the the resolution is good enough to identify the person right so it is it is it is possible to fit a picture in um I we've we've got them down to about like 1 the entire VC we've got down to about like 1.5 kilobytes.
[2025-02-18T17:46:44.291Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Got it yeah.
[2025-02-18T17:47:05.423Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: In in 90% of that is the picture data highly compressed image data so it's totally doable but the QR codes are fairly gigantic we're talking about like 2 inch by 2 inch QR codes and they can't fit on this ID card here um 1 of the interesting things though that we found in the first responder Community is that they're like yeah we don't really care about what the person looks like we just care that like a first respond we we like what they have to go buy right now is like a laminated badge printed out on an inkjet printer and anything is better like anything with a digital signature is like way better right um so so so so what they're saying is like you we don't need the picture like just put the picture on the badge we know it would be like super great if we could get the picture in there but um but uh if we can't like we we want these QR codes like an inch by an inch in size which basically means we need to keep the size of the credential down below 5.
[2025-02-18T17:47:06.125Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  5 500 by.
[2025-02-18T17:47:26.733Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So 40000 bytes uh which basically means we can maybe stick in like the person's first name last name their badge number um and then which agency issued the uh the credential and that's usually good enough for them to do auditing right I mean because because.
[2025-02-18T17:47:36.233Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: I see I see I uh in in asking I forgot that you have all that space on the badge to actually print out you don't need to stuff the full picture into the QR code that makes sense.
[2025-02-18T17:47:36.530Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin:  that makes.
[2025-02-18T17:48:03.475Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah yeah but but you know as as you know like the danger there is like what if somebody comes in and does a photo Photoshop attack they replace the picture they steal somebody else's QR code they put their picture on there um that that kind it is still possible with just the printed badge um that's why we're looking at like you know NFC because NFC doesn't have to just be on a mobile phone it can be on a TAP card right and those cards cost $2.50 and that is.
[2025-02-18T17:48:03.845Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  a a.
[2025-02-18T17:48:10.727Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: They're more than willing to pay because what they pay today is $55 a card for a PIV card.
[2025-02-18T17:48:13.469Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Right got it got it.
[2025-02-18T17:48:25.708Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Right so if we can fit this thing in in in 4 kilobytes on an NFC card and they really need to you know verify the person's picture then at that point they can tap for 4 seconds to read it off the NFC card.
[2025-02-18T17:48:29.693Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Did that answer your question okay.
[2025-02-18T17:48:33.073Z]	<Dmitri_Zagidulin>	q?
[2025-02-18T17:48:40.901Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That makes uh that makes so much sense yes it does yes so uh if if I if there's nobody else in the queue I want to ask a question about DS uh which is so I'm assuming that for offline verifiability uh using did keys.
[2025-02-18T17:48:53.154Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Uh so what's the on the verifier side what's the envisioned architecture like uh on the with the um issuer registry part.
[2025-02-18T17:49:02.765Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Is is the idea that the verifiers would preload the DS of the signing Registries or are you thinking like hierarchical.
[2025-02-18T17:49:37.229Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: No it's it's preload the the list is is where we are right now so that you know we're still trying to as as is everyone in the ecosystem we're still trying to figure out what the best way to deploy you know that that list of issuers is we we are largely so we're using a combination either did web or did key right um and we're we're kind of finding out that it doesn't really matter it just needs to be on the latest list um so that so specifically you know did key versus did web doesn't tend to matter too much at this point but we would expect.
[2025-02-18T17:49:37.756Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Except for the offline part right.
[2025-02-18T17:49:44.781Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Oh yeah okay.
[2025-02-18T17:49:55.447Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: That makes sense.
[2025-02-18T17:50:38.149Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Well no cuz cuz did Webb they the cashing and aggressive caching so the the the answer to the offline thing is like aggressive caching you know first responder agencies don't just like randomly pop up and go away overnight right they usually there for years at a time they typically have they all have email like if you're in a first responder you know group you have um you know email you've got a domain of some kind um and so did web is a is a reasonable way to do it um but you know there are some like all those volunteer fire departments many of them don't have a web presence or domain presence and so that's where did key can be you know a better a better solution for them um there there is like you know there are National Registries that exist for First Responders and so um uh having a the the problem as you know Demitri that is.
[2025-02-18T17:50:38.578Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  always like.
[2025-02-18T17:51:21.095Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Okay so who is going to maintain and serve up this list like who in who in The Who in the first responder community and it's like you know the firefighters are like oh well we'll take care of our own list um and then the EMTs are like know we've got our own list that's our purview right in in the states are like uh uh know we're State and so we will maintain our list so again like the ugly side of decentralization you know shows up which is like all right who's in charge list I I don't think we've we don't have a clean solution we don't have a clean answer for that um because fundamentally they don't want to centralize you know that.
[2025-02-18T17:51:25.264Z]	<Transcriber>	Dmitri_Zagidulin: Understood thank you so much that that answers my.
[2025-02-18T17:51:27.812Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Sure thing great questions.
[2025-02-18T17:51:40.564Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Oh wait yeah money uh just uh Curious like in the offline scenario uh when someone scanned the barcode but then you open the website but then it's offline like how do you do the verifications.
[2025-02-18T17:52:12.262Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Off offline website so so websites as long as they loaded the website once um you can use service workers so that the website continues to operate offline um and the things that that website needs offline are like you know who are the who are the known you know list of trusted issuers um and then that that's pretty much it and then it needs their it needs you know the code downloaded from the website which happens the first time you go to the website um so they're offline they're just typical web offline apps.
[2025-02-18T17:52:15.400Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yeah like Progressive web app basically right yeah okay.
[2025-02-18T17:52:15.875Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah exactly yep yep.
[2025-02-18T17:52:22.012Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: The assumptions that the verifier needs to load the website before going offline essentially.
[2025-02-18T17:52:43.985Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah at least once yeah yeah and and again I mean these these you know the incident commanders the incident response teams and the resource officers they you know they trained for this like and so they run multiple different you know um if they don't have a real disaster they have simulated disasters throughout the year that they run through and so the chances that they would have.
[2025-02-18T17:52:44.564Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	ack harrison
[2025-02-18T17:52:55.427Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The website uh before an actual disaster happens is is very high especially if it is a part of their kind of operational manual um which they're all required to have.
[2025-02-18T17:53:01.316Z]	<Przemek_Praszczalek>	present+
[2025-02-18T17:53:07.155Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: So so earlier when Dimitri talked about the Deep Web like the Registries and things like that it's also loaded basically through the progressive web app scenario okay got it.
[2025-02-18T17:53:07.870Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: That's right you got it yep.
[2025-02-18T17:53:18.974Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: All the Deads all the key information you know all that kind of stuff even the revocation lists if they if they have them would be loaded into that app um whenever they have a network connection.
[2025-02-18T17:53:25.450Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: I think the other thing that's important is that the the chances of them not having power.
[2025-02-18T17:53:44.563Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Way higher than them not having a network connection so if you look at any of the satellite based networks you know if you look at a 1 website it is very rare that they're truly offline um and and if they are they're only offline for like.
[2025-02-18T17:53:44.911Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  a very.
[2025-02-18T17:53:53.064Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Any last questions.
[2025-02-18T17:53:54.018Z]	<Harrison_Tang>	q?
[2025-02-18T17:54:13.504Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: By the way a follow-up question um for the VC over Wireless uh and Bluetooth like uh I'm just curious how far the challenges there right uh is it similar kind of challenges like the VC barcode or is it different.
[2025-02-18T17:54:56.697Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah so so there are 3 classes of challenges there um almost all of the challenges have to do with like um so with with the QR code the challenge is always like the size of the QR code you want to keep it really small which means you're verifiable credential needs to come in somewhere between 300 to 500 bytes if you want to fit it on like 1 of these ID cards um which is not a lot of space right especially when the digital signature takes up like 64 bytes and the and the and the you know the the did key or whatever takes up another like 32 bytes half your payload is already gone in like signature and key key key values um uh.
[2025-02-18T17:55:57.349Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So so size is really important for QR codes and for NFC because NFC it's like you can only transmit 1,000 bytes a second and while that sounds like a non it it sounds like a lot it really is not so you're looking at like 1500 bytes if you're doing it over NFC you'll probably top out about 2 kilobytes 2,000 bytes is um for you know for the types of interactions that most people are are used to um and then for Bluetooth there's a good chance that your other device doesn't have Bluetooth on it so if you're doing like phone to phone maybe it has it or maybe the person on the other side forgot to turn their Bluetooth on in in their fumbling around with their phone trying to turn the Bluetooth on um uh you know maybe there's a mismatch in in Bluetooth protocols you know all kinds of bad things happen with Bluetooth but if you can get up to a Bluetooth connection then you can send like megabytes you know no problem.
[2025-02-18T17:56:58.859Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The what we found is the challenge is kind of like up uh up upgrading in in protocol so if you like go from NFC to Bluetooth we've seen some you know interactions with like mdl where they're like you know SC the QR code or tap the phone and then they'll need to like interact with their phone all over again to like actually transmit the credential whereas with NFC like people are very trained to just tap and go right with payments it's like take your credit card tap it to the terminal um if you're on you know have a metro Subway card you take it you tap it to the the reader to open the gate um people are not used to like tapping their phone and then looking at the screen and having to make a whole bunch of like you know selections and then you know the Bluetooth thing um going over so um there is a usability challenge as well um when you bring Bluetooth into the mix um but sometimes you like you.
[2025-02-18T17:56:59.393Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny:  don't have.
[2025-02-18T17:57:10.781Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Don't have an option like when we when we go to post-quantum cryptography it's going to have to almost certainly happen over over Bluetooth because of the signature sizes um.
[2025-02-18T17:58:09.885Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: The other thing I didn't mention didn't didn't focus on quite here is like there is a huge education credential part of what we're doing here right the first thing is knowing whether or not the person's a first responder but then you need to kind of what they really want is to understand the First Responders skill set so they're like you know so they know if this firefighter is trained to fight a certain type of chemical fire or if this EMT is capable of operating in a neonatal field unit right um so knowing what who's showing up and what skill set they're bringing to the disaster to help um is vital because sometimes it can take like hours upon hours to figure out what everyone's capable of and that means that you know people that are in in danger are put in more danger because they can't be pulled out by the by the right people showing up um sooner than later.
[2025-02-18T17:58:14.224Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
[2025-02-18T17:58:17.653Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Hello 1 last question then the.
[2025-02-18T17:58:24.149Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Who's kind of certified these skills like basically the issuers that do do that right basically.
[2025-02-18T17:58:42.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Yeah each state has their own certification body their their National certification bodies like National Registry of emergency medical technicians um their state training facilities so typically you know people go to a community college or a local college or university to train as a first responder.
[2025-02-18T17:58:42.929Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Go through a.
[2025-02-18T17:59:29.483Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: Test that'll go and they'll be licensed through some kind of state process um and then there's some national accreditation processes as well it's also very decentralized you know system like just like education is right I mean the training First Responders is just a variation on the education use cases uh and as you know uh Carrie and Sharon and Dmitri can tell you like it's a very diverse and decentralized um uh area but the good news there though is like we've got vce to you and like they're working on that right and that everything that VCU is doing is massively helping uh the this this first responder use case.
[2025-02-18T17:59:40.655Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thank you thanks Manu as always you have great presentations and great answers so thanks a lot for taking the time.
[2025-02-18T17:59:42.974Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: So I appreciate appreciate the opportunity to come and present.
[2025-02-18T17:59:43.209Z]	<Kerri_Lemoie>	Thanks, Manu!
[2025-02-18T17:59:46.993Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: And thank you to everyone in the community that's doing work here like.
[2025-02-18T17:59:51.506Z]	<Transcriber>	Manu_Sporny: People write in their greatest greatest time of need.
[2025-02-18T18:00:00.962Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Thanks a lot uh this concludes this week's ccg meeting thanks.

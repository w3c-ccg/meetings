<christophera> Good morning (I'm PST)!
<stuart_freeman> I occasionally have to leave and re-join to get 
  audio working
<manu_sporny> Recording needs to be turned on?
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: You're in the queue any questions.
Harrison_Tang: Thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Right so yeah just a quick note on the IP anyone 
  can participate in these calls however all substantive 
  contributions their ccg work items must be members of the CG with 
  full IP our agreements sign and make sure you have the w3c 
  account and the w3c community contributor license agreement are 
  those links are also in the emails that sent out and if you have 
  any questions please feel.

Harrison_Tang: A quick call notes meeting minutes and audio 
  recordings are published a few days after this meeting and they 
  can be found in the GitHub account we use the GT chat to Q 
  speakers doing the cause was to take minutes so I think you plus 
  to add yourself to the Q where Q - to remove.
Harrison_Tang:  now any.
Harrison_Tang: Shouldn't or reintroduction if you're new to the 
  ccg or you haven't been active for a while but you want to 
  reintroduce yourself please feel free to unmute.
<christophera> (I'll hold off until presentation)
Harrison_Tang: How do I sorry I don't put your name.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you welcome welcome pets week.
Juan Caballero: :+1:
Harrison_Tang: Anyone else I want you to introduce or reintroduce 
  yourself please feel free to just unmute or for typing cubed 
  plus.
Wolf_McNally: I know I'm presenting but I'll just briefly 
  introduce myself I'm wolf McNally I'm the lead researcher with 
  blockchain Commons and I've been working in technology my whole 
  life and I'm in my late 50s now so and you know I consider myself 
  to be a creative technologist I worked in a lot of different 
  projects of the years I just don't love iPhone app development as 
  well as you know kind of more abstract things and you know 
  excited to be here this is my first time.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you all thank you for taking the time to 
  please end the swamp.
Harrison_Tang: Any other introductions were reintroduction.
Shannon_Appelcline: I am Shannon Apple Kline and I'm with 
  blockchain Commons also I'm a technical writer there.
Harrison_Tang: Welcome Shannon thank you for taking the time to 
  join us.
Harrison_Tang: All right any announcements or reminders.
Kaliya Young:  Hi we've got the APAC digital identity I'm 
  conference coming up March 1 2 3 in Bangkok Thailand that's awful 
  Biometrics Workshop has been changed to be only one day March 
  16th and of course regular IW has registration open and that 
  event happens in Mountain View California and it's April 16 to 
  20.
Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you Clea on you.
Manu Sporny:  We lost the window um yeah two announcements the 
  first is that the World Wide Web consortiums new public interest 
  nonprofit organization has been launched so for those of you that 
  may have been aware over the last year they have tried to migrate 
  from a kind of hosted organization hosted by MIT in the US or Sim 
  and Europe they hung in China and.
Manu Sporny:   KO in Japan.
<manu_sporny> W3C's new public-interest non-profit organization 
  has been launched: 
  https://www.w3.org/2023/01/pressrelease-w3c-le-launched.html.en
Manu Sporny:  Move into their Global nonprofit the press release 
  just went out and putting that in the chat Channel just 
  announcing the new transition it won't affect any of our work but 
  this is kind of the end of a rough ride last year and you know 
  things things resulted in the good thing happening so that's the 
  first item.
Manu Sporny:   The next item is.
<bumblefudge> minor announcement for people attending ETH Denver: 
  there will be two identity-adjacent events the day before eth 
  denver, if you haven't booked travel yet!
<bumblefudge> 1.) 
  https://twitter.com/SpruceID/status/1617592922551222272 (already 
  sold out?)
<bumblefudge> 2.) https://walletcon.com
Manu Sporny:  That the verifiable credentials face-to-face 
  meeting is coming up in Miami that is in the middle of February 
  the week of February 13th if you are not a it's w3c member only 
  accept that invited experts are invited to participate in if you 
  want to be an observer in person at the meeting you can also ask 
  the chairs.
Manu Sporny:  As well it's looking to be what is it around 25 24 
  people participating most people in person some people remote 
  that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you Manya.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements or reminders.
Juan Caballero:  I dropped some stuff in the chat just might.
Harrison_Tang: Cool did you mind actually just share it because a 
  lot of times the chat log is quite busy yeah.
Kaliya Young: https://apacdigitalid.org/
Juan Caballero:  Oh yeah right sorry and let some people don't 
  call in from phones I was just announcing two small side events 
  at East End about identity if anyone is thinking about he's 
  Denver links links are in the chat.
Harrison_Tang: Sounds good thank you thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: Let me check the queue.
Kaliya Young: https://www.thoughtfulbiometrics.org/
Harrison_Tang: Any other Chris please.
Chris_Kelly_(DIF): Hi Chris Kelly from decentralized Identity 
  Foundation if here just to let people know we have hired a new 
  full-time executive director and tomorrow is her first day so 
  keep an eye out for those announcements tomorrow.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thank you Chris.
Harrison_Tang: Hi bubble funds you have other announcement.
Juan Caballero:  Oh no sorry humanist I was just Emoji the Nuit.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you thanks a lot any other 
  announcements were reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Comments on the work items.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah just a quick the call for adoption for the Eds 
  a crypto sweet happens tomorrow in the verifiable credentials 
  working group so if you are supportive of those crypto sweets 
  please support by either sending an email into the mailing list 
  or showing up on the call and showing your support this is the 
  crypto Suite that is used across the nation wide.
Manu Sporny:   I'd digital age verification.
Manu Sporny:  G true age National Association convenience store 
  it is also the crypto sweet that we lost a large number of 
  organizations use to demonstrate demonstrate interoperability 
  during the jobs for the future plugfest to so there's a lot of 
  usage of it in as we move it into the verify the credentials of 
  working group it's good to show up and show your support of that 
  Crypt is sweet that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you money.
Harrison_Tang: And other announcements reminders or comments on 
  the work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda so this 
  week we're very pleased to have Christopher wolves and Shannon 
  from botching comments to a present on the supporting divisions 
  on with gordian envelopes obviously a lot of you guys know 
  Christopher he was the former w3c ccg culture and the co-author 
  of Transport layer security so he has quite a bit of knowledge to 
  say the least about.
<rgrant> also one of the coauthors of did:btcr!
Harrison_Tang: The standards and protocols silda very very 
  pleased and very very honor to have him present on Korean 
  envelope and hope everyone has read the high voltage High over 
  overview high level overview or the intro video that send out in 
  the links know if you want to go over those things and also the 
  today's our presentation slide please just refer to the email 
  that's sent out or email me and I can send those information to 
  you.
Harrison_Tang:  you thank you so without further ado.
<christophera> Gordian Envelope Intro: 
  https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Envelope-Intro/
Harrison_Tang: Come on Christopher Wall for Jenna thanks a lot.
Christopher Allen:  Thank you very much I'm going to let Wolf 
  start off with a brief recap well.
Wolf_McNally: Yeah so if you've actually let me see if I can just 
  share my screen here.
Wolf_McNally: Okay here we go so I just have a few slides as 
  Harrison mentioned they're available as a PDF as well and this 
  will recapitulate a little bit of what's in our introduction but 
  though there's some new material here as well so if you've seen I 
  hope it'll be worth your time you can all see my screen now is 
  that correct.
Wolf_McNally: Okay great so yeah so just a little bit about 
  blockchain comments and of course Christopher can speak to the 
  mission in much more detail this is the website and I'll urge you 
  to visit watching comments not calm generally speaking we're 
  community that brings together stakeholders to build open 
  interoperable and securing compassion infrastructure and we 
  designed a centralized Solutions where everyone wins we're a 
  non-profit so we want people to be able to control their own 
  digital Destiny so all the work we do is open source we do.
<christophera> /c/non-profit/not-for-profit
Wolf_McNally: Reference library as we do full apps but they're 
  all open source so and so I definitely recommend you check out 
  our GitHub account and the website is good starting place for 
  that so jumping into Guardian envelopes we started with the 
  metaphor of an envelope because it's actually a very interesting 
  and very deep one surprisingly because when you think about 
  envelopes they're used to hold many kinds of things plain text 
  you can put encrypted text in an envelope you can redact text in 
  an envelope.
Wolf_McNally:  you can.
<bumblefudge> redact???
Wolf_McNally: Signed things in envelope you can put a small 
  amount of deer like that QR code or huge amount of data into an 
  envelope an envelope itself is also a document can be having 
  there's on things on the outside that identify the sender 
  identify the receiver control who has access to the contents of 
  it reveal part of the content without without revealing the whole 
  thing so envelopes are a great starting place to think about 
  digital documents and what we realized when we thought about the 
  structure.
Wolf_McNally: You're on the envelopes could containers was 
  obelisks themselves we realized it had a hierarchical nested kind 
  of structure a document is basically a subject and a set of 
  information about that subject but the subject itself could be 
  rich in hoods it could be a document itself and so can be the 
  information so in fact you know starting from this point we 
  realized you know it could be envelopes all the way down 
  arbitrarily because it's digital so my starting point for 
  thinking about designing the envelope.
Wolf_McNally:  sure was a very simple couple of structures.
Wolf_McNally: The pseudocode this is Swift but you know it may as 
  well be Sealcoat I'm gonna emphasize as you look at this is not 
  the actual envelope structure I'll show that in a moment it's not 
  much more complex but this is a good start with starting think 
  about it there's an envelope is a subject in a set of assertions 
  about that subject the envelope itself is a subject is not the 
  subject itself is an envelope so it's a nested recursive 
  structure as well as the assertions are consists of a predicate 
  and object which are themselves envelopes so already your by 
  recognizing here the the cement.
Wolf_McNally:  triple idea that we have a subject that we have 
  predicate object predicate object about that subject so those are 
  triples but it gets more interesting than that.
<kaliya_identity_woman> slides are not showing?
<mahmoud_alkhraishi> i can see them
<mprorock> showing on my side
Wolf_McNally: If we just want to represent a triple this is what 
  I call envelope notation this is a simple triple Alice knows Bob 
  where we have the subject and we have an array which is the set 
  of predicates and objects that form the assertions of on that 
  subject so here is a much closer representation of the actual 
  specified and implemented envelope that we currently have It's 
  actually an enumerated type it's got seven cases and this allows 
  us to do more complex things for example a bear subject will.
Wolf_McNally:  callous a bare assertion knows Bob as well as 
  alighted in encrypted and that's.
Wolf_McNally: Going to talk.
<christophera> (sometimes in jitsi you need to hit play)
Wolf_McNally: Today is envelopes capability to to elide and 
  encrypt various parts of the varietal various elements of the 
  envelope because remember an envelope is basically nested 
  envelopes so you'll sometimes hear me use the term element kind 
  of interchangeably so let's take a closer look at this particular 
  symmetric triple the interesting thing about what falls out of 
  the structure is that there are basically five positions in the 
  structure which we can transform.
Wolf_McNally:  and I want to go through each of those positions 
  you can kind of get start to get the idea.
Wolf_McNally: Of the structure the first position is the subject 
  of self and on the left hand side where you see the duplicate 
  their I'm going to elide each of these five positions on the 
  right hand side I'm going to be adding an assertion for each of 
  those five positions so if we start with the first position 
  that's the subject in this case that's Alice so in this case 
  we're on the left hand side we're a lighting Alice and when we 
  align something we're just leaving the the digest in place so we 
  actually have envelopes are a tree a Merkle Tree in fact we're.
Wolf_McNally:  there's a root digestive which represents the 
  whole envelope and then.
<orie> Merkle Trees!
Wolf_McNally: There's a digest for just the subject in this case 
  we're just leaving that digest in place and Route a lighting the 
  actual data and you'll hear me use the term Elysian or Allied 
  it's often thought of as redaction as we thought about this we 
  realize that reduction is like a use case of Illusion illusion is 
  to emit data redaction is to deliberate with hold data and 
  there's several different use cases for religions so that's the 
  reason why I use that term instead of just simply say we're 
  doubt.
Wolf_McNally:  on the right hand side you can see I've added 
  another assertion to the.
Wolf_McNally: To the subject so again it's a subject in a series 
  of sessions on the subject all right so moving on to the second 
  position this is the predicate in this case we're lighting the 
  word the the the term nose and on the right hand side we've added 
  another another assertion or its first assertion to the to the to 
  the predicate and this allows you to have much more richer data 
  representations as you can see you can put any kind of context or 
  anything you want on any part of the envelope so.
Wolf_McNally:  this could be a URI or could be some kind of owl 
  specifier some.
Wolf_McNally: So moving on to the third position this is the 
  object Bob same idea we're alighting on the left and adding an 
  assertion on the right.
Wolf_McNally: The fourth edition is the assertion itself so in 
  this case we've invited the entire certian and so we can remove 
  it.
<christophera> oops, lost wolf
<david_waite> (uh-oh)
Wolf_McNally: Our side you see yes question.
Christopher Allen:  Is that you we lost you for a second go go to 
  the beginning of.
Wolf_McNally: For okay so you have any back now.
<kim_hamilton_duffy> The CG bot pop ups are maddening— is there a 
  setting to squash them? Couldn’t find
Wolf_McNally: Okay so yeah this is this is the actual the 
  assertion position itself on the left hand side you see we live 
  the entire knows Bob assertion and the right hand side we're 
  adding an assertion to the assertion so again you can Nest this 
  as deeply as you want because the assertion itself that we're 
  adding is itself a predicate and object envelope so you can be as 
  rich as you want about this finally the fifth position the 
  envelope itself on the left hand side we would lie to the entire 
  envelope and just left the root.
Wolf_McNally:  digest which.
<manu_sporny> Kim, what pop-ups? If you don't show the chat -- is 
  that what you're referring to?
Wolf_McNally: Envelope and the right hand side we've wrapped the 
  envelope and then added an assertion to that and what I mean by 
  wrapping is that if you just add an assertion to a subject you're 
  just sort of starting something about the subject itself but what 
  if you want for example sign the whole envelope well in that case 
  you wrap it and you add the signature to as an assertion to the 
  wrapped envelope in which case now you've basically signed the 
  whole inner envelope so that's one of many use cases for wrapping 
  envelopes.
Wolf_McNally:  and of course anything you've seen here that can 
  be a lighted can also be encrypted using.
Wolf_McNally: Symmetric key cryptography.
<christophera> (you can X the chat, and you'll not see popups)
<manu_sporny> I have to /show/ the chat to not see pop-ups :)
Wolf_McNally: But these assertions can contain what we call 
  permits which are various kinds of ways for example encrypted the 
  symmetric key encryption to a public key so it can be encrypted 
  to specific recipients or can be sharded using RSS K are sharing 
  algorithm which basically lets you short a secret and distribute 
  it to a number of escrow holders who have to reach a quorum to 
  reassemble the original secret so it's actually very flexible.
Wolf_McNally:  so one of the other things about envelopes as we 
  wanted them to be structure.
<kim_hamilton_duffy> Maybe it’s an issue with viewing on the 
  phone. I see either wolfs screen or the chat. If I x the chat 
  popups block the view
Wolf_McNally: One of them to be able to represent an up left 
  corner there you actually see a mermaid diagram of an of an 
  actual envelope so obviously representing trees is very natural 
  for it but we also want to represent no little graphs Edge 
  liberal graphs are DSL or an artificial star cell graphs or even 
  simple simpler things like just lists and because we are based on 
  we created the structure based on Seymour not on Json is is 
  common.
Wolf_McNally:  at a very low level there's a you can represent.
<kayode_ezike> Yes, I have also experienced what Kim is 
  describing on the mobile experience recently
<mprorock> yay cbor
<kim_hamilton_duffy> Gonna try
<orie> Similar to ACDCs, but much simpler.
<david_waite> under settings/more, you can change chat 
  notifications - but I think you have to log in for it to persist
Wolf_McNally: You can represent Seaboard for simple just a 
  straight array such as in rev envelopes and a little bit more 
  about see bore because this is one of the main choices we made 
  this foundational to this to this format is we wanted we looked 
  at all the different kinds of formats out there for data 
  serialization we want to one that was binary we want to be 
  concise that's you know we want to be very short things should be 
  very short we want it to be self-describing so you didn't 
  necessarily need a external schema already present feel to at 
  least parse the.
Wolf_McNally:  the document we want it to be something that that 
  codex could be written in very few lines of code so Chopper.
<kim_hamilton_duffy> Gonna try web vs app. It’s maddening
<mprorock> IETF draft
Wolf_McNally: We wanted to be platform and language agnostic we 
  wanted it to have been through the standards process and it is a 
  ietf standard and we also wanted something that we want to a 
  predefined set of guidelines and rules for deterministic encoding 
  the idea being that if two people assemble the same envelope from 
  the same information it doesn't matter the for example the out of 
  the order the add the assertions there should be one 
  automatically baked in canonical representation of that data so 
  there's no normalization or anything like that.
Wolf_McNally: You when you seminar what it's already normalized.
<shannona_> Here's more on Why CBOR: 
  https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Why-CBOR/
Wolf_McNally: And we also have a contar video describing why we 
  chose to go to see more if you want more detail on that our 
  internet draft is here and the next couple Pages have links so 
  have a QR codes so if you want to snap one that's fine or you can 
  get the PDF and just go directly to these links but this is our 
  this is our internet draft that describes the the basic 
  fundamental structure of envelopes we have a lot more detailed 
  documents on our GitHub repository.
Wolf_McNally:  and there's also a number of use cases which are 
  very interesting which aren't really very easily done.
Wolf_McNally: You know this.
<mprorock> ID, Experimental: 
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mcnally-envelope/
Wolf_McNally: For example user-based Elysian so the holder of a 
  document can then elide parts of the document before passing on 
  to other people they can also relied for example I can pass you 
  just the root level digest and then create proofs about what is 
  in that what is in that what that digests must necessarily 
  contain by creating minimal spanning trees of minimal training 
  graphs of what I want to prove you can also do heard based 
  privacy where many people create a document together that is.
Wolf_McNally:  partially alighted.
<shannona_> All of the use cases we've written, with lots of 
  examples of what Gordian Envelopes really look like: 
  https://www.blockchaincommons.com/introduction/Gordian-Envelope-Use-Cases/
Wolf_McNally: I did and then people can reveal just their part of 
  the document the part that they are able to with while leaving 
  everything else both committed in the document as well as but but 
  also still hit so those are a few points starting point for 
  discussion and you know I'm sure Chris will just some questions 
  better than me but feel free to reach out to either of us and you 
  know very happy to have been able to present this here I hope the 
  discussion that follows is very interesting thank you.
Christopher Allen:  Thank you all so I just wanted to explain a 
  little bit about you know where this fits in with w3c so part of 
  my goal here is that.
Christopher Allen:  Really what does radical Elysian privacy mean 
  how do we build that at the bottom and then build up from there 
  so gordian envelope is not exactly the equivalent of verifiable 
  credential or idid it's not it's a data format which is structure 
  already so you could put in a w3c verifiable credential into it 
  using kind of a label graph structure you can put other kinds.
Christopher Allen:   Kinds of credentials and using other.
Christopher Allen:  You can choose to do cryptographic selective 
  disclosure as opposed to The hash-based Selective disclosure we 
  have etcetera so I just want to be clear it's not intended as a 
  as a replacement for be seized or anything so let's be clear on 
  that the other thing I want to be clear on is that it allows for 
  some opportunities that are not possible right now with third of 
  the json-ld.
Christopher Allen:   The family.
Christopher Allen:  Inspire the future of that family so we can 
  do radical things like half say Harvard issue one giant 
  verifiable credential lowercase b digital credential for the 
  entire class of 2025 and rather than actually offering individual 
  credentials it just offers the individual the holders the 
  subjects proofs that their information is in that structure but 
  in fact.
Christopher Allen:   Carpet maybe only publishes the root hash.
Christopher Allen:  In a couple.
Christopher Allen:  Desertion to say that they're in a credit 
  organization this allows for a lot of heard privacy opportunities 
  also I think there's some interesting possibilities of kind of 
  allowing for heard privacy with d ID style structures with you 
  know brunette with revocation type structures proof that you're 
  still included things of that nature so I was really trying to do 
  that as an inspiration.
Christopher Allen:   And I'd really like to see that.
Christopher Allen:  Years time that when the new specs come out 
  for verifiable credentials that there is a must support some form 
  of selective disclosure at least you know cash based is simple 
  and there are three or four proposals out there for how we might 
  be able to do that beyond what gordian offers but we can show 
  that it works now I mean these you know all of these examples in 
  our use cases are functioning now you can test them with our 
  command line app.
Christopher Allen:   And they're ready to they work they do it.
<kim_hamilton_duffy>	trick in the app is: settings > more > 
  display notifications for messages
Christopher Allen:  So we are a community we are largely 
  supported by the blockchain community but we would really like 
  these structures to be available to the identity Community 
  because I think they solve some problems or at least Inspire some 
  solutions for the w3c so I'll leave it to questions Harrison do 
  you want to do the Q honors.
<shannona_> The envelope CLI: 
  https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/envelope-cli-swift
Harrison_Tang: Yes Mike I think I see you on the queue.
<greg_bernstein> How does this compare to BBS+ signatures?
<kim_hamilton_duffy> but I missed the presentation
Mike Prorock:  Yeah I managed to beat mana and now I mean huge 
  amount of awesome work here I mean it's definitely a really 
  fascinating idea right this notion you know the underlying 
  Notions behind rdf are really common and good and it key to 
  semantics and things like that right especially as we look at 
  these Bridges with machine learning and being a big see more fan 
  real you know really happy with that directionality of like how 
  do we move this into a scalable way.
Mike Prorock:   My question is more on the standards track side 
  of things and things like that I mean.
Mike Prorock:  Obviously it's an ID it's marked experimental I 
  mean do you think there's a natural home for this at ietf be it 
  in cozy or somewhere like that you know because Seymour's and 
  maintenance mode I mean what's your thinking there I mean do you 
  think that this is going to go standards track do you think that 
  there's a natural group are you trying to form a bomb off I mean 
  what's your what's your feelings and all that.
Christopher Allen:  Well some of it depends on what happens with 
  this community and where we want to go here I mean it is a c bar 
  structure and it is kind of a really nice addition and I think it 
  can breathe some life into Seymour Seymour has had a lot of 
  success in constrained environments you're also seeing it in 
  things like mobile driver's license and things and things of that 
  nature but it's pretty solid.
Christopher Allen:   But it has a very limited structure capable.
Christopher Allen:  What do you.
Christopher Allen:  Being able to do you know graph structure so 
  I think this adds some very basic graph structures to it and thus 
  it's worthy of consideration in the ITF but I have is not going 
  to do you know the the next layer up which is okay you know we've 
  got this great way where you can do Edge labeled graphs you know 
  node label graphs all different kinds of variations.
Christopher Allen:   They're what does that mean for.
Christopher Allen:  Data models for credentials and other kinds 
  of assertions that probably needs to be in the w3c cuz that's 
  where mower the Innovative work is done that being said other 
  places in the ITF that you know this might be of interest is the 
  the software control it's the source code evaluation work that is 
  being done.
Christopher Allen:   I think there's some really interesting.
Christopher Allen:  He's there to allow for anonymous 
  contributors who have reputations to have assertions because 
  these these trees can all be merged in different ways and you can 
  make basically signatures of different parts of the trees that 
  really allows for things like oh you know I've done a Security 
  review of this amount of code and somebody else has done a 
  Security review of this amount of code and we can together assert 
  you know.
Christopher Allen:   Oh that you know we have.
Christopher Allen:  The union of these two is that you know we 
  can prove is the total of all of that and also a potentially 
  preserve our personal privacy if we're in Iran or Russia or some 
  other place where there is a concern and yet we are you know 
  adjudged by the community to be were the actors so want to be 
  able to support those things I don't know if it persists it's 
  somewhat orthogonal to Cozy.
Christopher Allen:   Hey there's no reason why you can't.
Christopher Allen:  Now Jose any steep or objects can be in 
  envelope we you know envelope apis can give you just a hash you 
  can sign that hash of any particular part of the structure and 
  then you know add an assertion for that boom your Posse because 
  they won't take advantage of the Elysian pressure so.
Mike Prorock:  Yeah it's that syntax side that you're layering on 
  which is really neat so yeah it's pretty neat.
Christopher Allen:  Yeah so same thing with already it you know 
  with rdf for rdf Star which I'm not sure if any of this community 
  is being involved in you know we can certainly put those types of 
  objects in but if you really want to take advantage of bird 
  privacy and and proof of inclusion and some of the more advanced 
  lesion redaction encryption reference capabilities of gordian 
  envelope you're going to have to tweak those to take full 
  advantage.
Christopher Allen:   I'm done.
Mike Prorock:  Cool thanks I'll hand it back to Harrison and 
  that's that's my question for the day.
Manu Sporny:  Yes thanks Christopher and Wolf the the 
  presentation was a great introduction I haven't had a chance to 
  dig super deep into it so apologies if the questions are a bit 
  rough or naive where I'm trying to I'm trying to create a mint at 
  least a mental model for how to think about this one way that in 
  tell me if this is wrong one way I'm looking at this is that you 
  know with verifiable credentials we kind of have this.
Manu Sporny:   Graph based data model and we express.
Manu Sporny:  And claims and properties and things like that 
  there and it can be mapped rdf but it could be mapped other our 
  graph models like the one that you're presenting here and I'm 
  wondering if I'm trying to figure out where these two kind of 
  intersects so I'm thinking if we've got you know verifiable 
  credentials as a graph of information in theory we should be able 
  to map it directly onto a gordian envelope and then use the 
  features that you're talking about.
Manu Sporny:   To elide.
<mprorock> CBOR extension as a syntax for graphs might make 
  sense, and CBOR maintenance does permit extensions
Manu Sporny:  To basically take that graph structure and express 
  it as effectively as I mean it feels like another digital proof 
  format it feels like we can take a verifiable credential we can 
  put it into a gordian envelope and use that as the digital proof 
  on the verifiable credential and if we were to do that that would 
  allow us to clearly aligned at the cryptographic layer but it 
  would allow us to also Allied kind of.
Manu Sporny:   Of at the data layer where the developers are kind 
  of like messing.
<mprorock> Wolf / Chris - i would love Carsten's thoughts if you 
  have them, and / or happy to discuss at 116
Manu Sporny:  Json-ld I'm but I'm kind of grasping in the dark I 
  don't know if that's how you meant this to be used or if it can 
  be used in that manner so what are your thoughts there like in 
  the intersection between what we're doing with graph based data 
  models in verifiable credentials in what you're doing with graph 
  based data models in the gordian stuff.
Christopher Allen:  Yeah so go ahead go ahead.
Wolf_McNally: I'll just make it to Quick technical comment which 
  is yeah which is that we haven't done any direct work on for 
  example mapping rdf or its or json-ld to or its variants to Gordy 
  envelopes at this point this is obviously something we'd like to 
  work with people on but you know obviously part of our motivation 
  for doing this is to not have to do the same kind.
Wolf_McNally:  of normalization steps and so on.
Wolf_McNally: That are required with json-ld and I'm very 
  interested in seeing how it Maps personally you know I like to I 
  like to know that it Maps because I haven't done many experiments 
  Long Island itself I have taken a few small rdf and json-ld 
  documents in kind of transcribe them myself to convince myself 
  that'll work that'll work but haven't done any formal work on 
  that.
Christopher Allen:  Yeah so basically you absolutely can do you 
  know the URI that rdf requires you can you know make statements 
  about the individual assertions so you can have the quad 
  equivalent without any you know challenges there you know I think 
  the real test is when it comes all together because there is 
  still this kind of weird intermix between.
Christopher Allen:  The credential and the proof format that in 
  the current data model that we may not be able to completely 
  solve easily especially with contacts and things of that nature 
  no reason why you can't insert a context into either a predicate 
  or into a assertion that there may be some complications there 
  part of the goal is to make it that it will work.
Christopher Allen:   Work with rdf style.
Christopher Allen:  And you know Ed style graphs which is you 
  know one of the other big Alternatives out there or just a list 
  like mdl one of the interesting things about an mdl is that you 
  know it's list it doesn't have a tree of selective disclosure 
  capabilities it basically is a list of items and you can align 
  anything on that on that list well we can offer some additional 
  capabilities where that we can have trees inside.
Christopher Allen:   Each of those items which the mdl well.
Christopher Allen:  Selective disclosure doesn't support hope 
  that helps but I think there's more experimentation in proving to 
  be done but since that is our goal we will support it if the 
  community wants to puzzle it out with us we can't do it by 
  ourselves.
Christopher Allen:   That's it.
Ryan Grant:  Yeah my question is very much about context can I 
  assume people can hear me I wanted to ask where the volcanic so I 
  know you said you haven't really solved context yet but you know 
  there's a lot of vocabulary issues handled by json-ld and I would 
  say also by known Fields represented through Json and say 
  something like a JWT.
Ryan Grant:  So my understanding is that Guardian envelope is 
  pretty sensible flexible encoding for the graph structure and 
  privacy protection that many of us are looking for in using these 
  other formats with these known fields and json-ld put a lot of 
  effort into understanding what is certain field exactly is and 
  that's that goes pretty deep into the.
Ryan Grant:  Shen and how it's solving those open world problems 
  so my presumption is that the understanding of what a field is is 
  a matter that would go inside this subject predicate object 
  format that you have here and I guess my question is.
Ryan Grant:   You know even if.
Ryan Grant:  These other like the say taking a json-ld thing and 
  representing it with Gordy and envelopes you still have to do the 
  other json-ld things right.
Wolf_McNally: Well certainly you if you're representing some kind 
  of Knowledge Graph or whatever you need to be based on some kind 
  of ontology you know we've tried to anticipate some of the needs 
  for example you know the size of the envelope is something that 
  we're concerned about because we want to be have it be useful in 
  constrained environments we have so one of those seven cases that 
  are pointed out is called a known value and the known value is 
  just a 64-bit integer which of course Json is very good at 
  encoding these things efficiently.
Wolf_McNally: And what the what that integer means is is not 
  predefined by the by the table spec itself we have a number of 
  particular values that we've been using in our experiments I 
  believe that over all this wood elves may be part of the 
  standardization process for the community or communities to carve 
  out parts of that 64-bit space to represent things like you know 
  is a or dereference by via or you know whatever you know kinds of 
  ontological.
Wolf_McNally:  terms you need.
Christopher Allen:  Now let me talk specifically so we're not 
  precisely the same.
Wolf_McNally: Pre-exists and you know and so I can see certainly 
  existing ontology is being mapped onto these simple integer so 
  you don't need to include whole URL you our eyes or anything like 
  that in the envelope you just reference them and they can be 
  predicates or they can be you know objects or they can be 
  assertions on Unpretty object Paris on assertions themselves so 
  you can you know you're again you have a lot of semantic 
  flexibility and of course you could still use full you are is if 
  you really want to do there's there's no reason to have to use 
  the known the known values.
Christopher Allen:  Level as json-ld is to rdf when you take 
  json-ld and the form that we always reference it in our specs 
  that's not actually what sign its go it goes through a 
  transformation into an rdf structure with you're doing the you 
  know you're getting the quads and and such we're a little bit 
  closer to the quads the you know the unwrapped json-ld I mean 
  that's one of the obstacles I've always had with json-ld is that 
  you know in a.
Christopher Allen:   In a naive way you can look at that friction 
  oh that's really cool.
Christopher Allen:  And then you try.
Christopher Allen:  Reproduce it and then you know somebody like 
  Longley will come along and say but wait a second that isn't 
  quite the way because when we take it to the next level this 
  hidden level of of quads we broken something because there's some 
  cheat cheats and shortcuts that happen in json-ld to make it very 
  readable and consumable and small so we're a little bit closer to 
  the quad side of the representation of json-ld or rdf the second 
  thing is.
Christopher Allen:   Is as far as compacting obviously we can 
  define a bunch of.
Christopher Allen:  Advocates there are other ways you can create 
  a sort of a child branch that has all the you are eyes and then 
  you have the hash of those you were eyes and so you can now 
  reference those hashes and other places and according envelopes 
  you can get that kind of compression that the see bore LD was 
  playing around with if you want so there's some.
Wolf_McNally: Yeah I should have mentioned that aside from just a 
  know these known values you know you can use digests anywhere you 
  can use digests as as references to objects that can be found 
  elsewhere even within the same document or across documents so 
  yeah you can use them to refer to entire ad hoc spaces that you 
  created that you know presumably people know how to dereference.
Christopher Allen:  So one of the concepts here is that something 
  the reason why we use the term Elysian is a you can have just the 
  hash so that means you can sign something that's encrypted or.
Christopher Allen:   Assign something that's.
Christopher Allen:  I didn't still you know be able to verify it 
  later when some other part is lighted or encrypted but what we 
  mean by encryption can be a lot of different things you can we 
  have this kind of this permit mechanism that could work for any 
  right now we have it with symmetric permits we have asymmetric 
  permits with public Keys we have ssk our permits which allows you 
  if you have sufficient copies a quorum of copies of it from 
  different.
Christopher Allen:   Different parties you can reconstruct and 
  then decrypt but there are a lot.
Christopher Allen:  Permits that are Kate are possible including 
  z caps and various kinds of smart signature scripts Etc can be 
  used as permit mechanisms that allows a lot of flexibility that 
  the other thing you can rely is your lighting by reference so you 
  can basically say here is this other gordian envelope someplace 
  else and here's the root hash of it and you know proofs of 
  inclusion are also gordian envelopes you could even include the 
  proof.
Christopher Allen:   And to show that you were proof that your 
  subset that was.
Christopher Allen:  It's for you was in that other envelope 
  obviously none of those precisely map to to json-ld 11 also 
  because we can label because we can put labels on the predicates 
  on the objects or on the predicate object pairs or on the whole 
  thing you know they're there are some opportunities that you know 
  a strict.
Christopher Allen:  Graph can't do because we can maybe move 
  those assertions some other place so it needs some expertise from 
  top level Experts of json-ld to say yeah this is potentially 
  valuable for us and let's map this out and and if there's 
  something that we've missed or you know can't be represented then 
  we want to fix it that's it.
Wolf_McNally: Yeah me too - Point earlier you know we you know 
  the morning envelope arose not just out of you know me I'm here 
  to sack dissatisfaction with for example certain aspects of 
  json-ld or whatever but but the idea that you know we wanted to 
  kind of take a green field approach to this and just say okay we 
  were designing the simplest but most flexible structure possible 
  what would that look like and this is what we came up with and so 
  is Chris worth mentioning.
Wolf_McNally:  you know we would.
Wolf_McNally: If in some ways it would be a superset of what 
  could be out there now obviously we need we still need the 
  community to help us test that that hypothesis.
Ryan Grant:  Got it thanks a lot.
Christopher Allen:  Also I mean clearly I motivation also is that 
  you know we I wish I knew what the actual numbers are but I 
  wouldn't be surprised if the number of people that are working on 
  digital credentials that are not doing json-ld may be as large or 
  larger especially in the sort of the more commercial side of some 
  of this type of stuff you know people saying I'm doing a 
  verifiable rental but it's no way not a verifiable credential.
Christopher Allen:  Um but part of the resistance I think has to 
  do with people being kind of flustered with you know oh wait a 
  second I just need it to be a damn list like mdl did well we can 
  support a damn list you know we don't need it to be a tree we 
  don't need it to be a graph structure if we don't want it to be 
  so we wanted to be able to support all of those.
<mprorock> have to drop unfortunately - really interesting stuff 
  here, early, but interesting
<mprorock> thanks!!!
Wolf_McNally: Some of my most some of the most basic examples of 
  Gordy envelope you'll see them when you read it our documentation 
  are just you know a text string or utf-8 string encoded it maybe 
  adds like three bites of overhead and that's a whole envelope 
  that contains a text string which is just as a better subject and 
  you know so getting simple things should be small and simple you 
  know.
Christopher Allen:  Okay next question.
Harrison_Tang: Text or if you're next in the queue.
Orie Steele:  So you basically gotten into what IQ to say which 
  is simple thing should remain simple I just wanted to comment on 
  mapping from json-ld verifiable credential data formats or media 
  types into accordion or into other structures those mappings are 
  painful sometimes depending on the complexity of the source 
  format and they can be error prone.
Orie Steele:   And then they can require additional libraries.
Orie Steele:  That you know we need to include to support so you 
  know mapping can be a great way of making it you know look like 
  the source format has lots and lots of different concrete 
  security formats that it can be implemented in and that can be 
  great and worth it if that Source data format is really highly 
  valuable but it's important that the security formats not be 
  overly fit to it and that they still be able to achieve those 
  smaller simpler use.
Orie Steele:   Cases like the list and examples you've given.
Orie Steele:  I just I think you know just be aware of thinking 
  mapping is a good idea mapping is the beginning of a road to pain 
  and at the end of that road there might be value but there also 
  might not be so just be careful with mapping.
Christopher Allen:  Yeah yeah yeah I'm not you know I'm I know 
  that if you do it naively you're going to end up either losing 
  some of the benefits of json-ld or whatever your mapping from or 
  lose the benefits accordion envelope I mean if you just you know 
  you can theater I just put a Gordon audience you know and 
  envelope tag and have one giant sea board structure that is has 
  nothing to do with gordian and then you know.
Christopher Allen:   It just you know it's.
Christopher Allen:  That's can be done but your neck not going to 
  be able to take advantage of either of those so but I do think 
  that the architecture is a really nice layer like we really mean 
  other than the fact that we have to define a hash algorithm 
  everything else is agnostic I mean you can sign things with 
  whatever you know proof method that you know needs they.
Christopher Allen:  Signs in doesn't have to itself do some some 
  magic the we can do it just feels like a really natural simple 
  layer that you can do other layers on top and maybe simplify some 
  of those other layers because they're not having to do all of 
  this.
Christopher Allen:   That's it.
Wolf_McNally: Yeah I should point out that you know our internet 
  draft you know basically points out that we've you know chosen 
  Blake three for our particular current reference implementations 
  but nothing in the spec actually locks you to any of that you 
  could do an implementation of Gordon envelope that uses whatever 
  Cipher Suite you want for whatever purposes you want but you know 
  in terms of widely adopted versions you know we'd like there to 
  be some consensus about what the best of best practices are for.
Wolf_McNally:  Krypto sweets and.
<shannona_> IETF Draft: 
  https://blockchaincommons.github.io/WIPs-IETF-draft-envelope/draft-mcnally-envelope.html
<orie> is blake FIPS ?
<christophera> c/Krypto sweets/crypto-sweets
Wolf_McNally: Just the minimal kind of opinionated set at least 
  for our reference implementations but you know this is where we 
  need to have a lot of input from the community so we really kind 
  of figure out if there is something that people can agree upon 
  enough to do this but we still think the structure itself has 
  value even if it needs to be adapted in certain ways by certain 
  parties to do certain things I would like to see it personally as 
  an interchange format that can be used by you know the world over 
  for wide variety of things but then there needs to be some 
  agreement about.
Wolf_McNally:  out how certain things like that.
<orie> i might choose a less flashy starting point, like sha256.
<christophera> c/crypto-sweets/crypto-suites
Wolf_McNally: Digest is going to be handled now because it's Ybor 
  and we do mention this internet draft you know we've taken some 
  pains to think about it as future proof that you know if we need 
  to introduce a new digest algorithm or some other crypto sweet 
  later you know Seaboard self is flexible enough to tag things as 
  being as having some kind of future structure and and so older 
  parsers may not be able to fully parse them but newer Parts is 
  can parse both the new and the old structures and so envelopes 
  can be as ephemeral as a.
Wolf_McNally:  a few milliseconds for a remote procedure call of 
  some kind or can be as big as a blockchain and.
Wolf_McNally: Will be future proof.
<orie> yeah, hardware support is a good thing to keep an eye on
Christopher Allen:  I want to quickly respond to Horry we are 
  looking at maybe stop 256 is a baseline we have more and more 
  because of the Silicon Salon chip acceleration and things of that 
  nature because on highly constrained devices as become more 
  important and so that's one direction we're pursuing and then the 
  other direction is right now with a hash.
Christopher Allen:   As tree you have to you know basically.
<orie> that also impacts your tool chain for CBOR.
<orie> poseidon lol
Christopher Allen:  Present all the hatches between the route 
  hatch and the top hash there are some new proof methods where a 
  tree can be represented even a million deep with only 96 bytes 
  using say a possible aside National so we are investigating that 
  and I'm talking with cryptographers now about what are the two 
  choices because I really feel like we need we I think we need one 
  that we're going to basically say is the base and then we have 
  we're going to basically.
Christopher Allen:   Deserve one.
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/blob/master/table.csv#L493
Christopher Allen:  Okay when the base expires or you know the 
  community is ready here's the second one and those will be that 
  will be the sweet and a sense I am much more want to go in the 
  direction of wire guard style choices or the way TLS really in 
  1.3 eliminated a bunch of sweets then go with any kind of 
  algorithmic agility we just have to make us some smart decisions 
  before people start shipping anything with this which I.
Christopher Allen:   I presume will be the.
Christopher Allen:  You know the.
Harrison_Tang: Call money you're next.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah thinking a bit more about you know where we're 
  all this kind of fits into the ecosystem I'm getting a clear 
  picture to address something Ryan said I don't think we have to 
  worry too much about kind of the semantic mapping like you know 
  json-ld exists and it uses a couple of basic Primitives to do 
  that mapping and I don't see any reason why gordian couldn't use 
  the same mechanism or use it optionally right so I don't think.
Manu Sporny:   Think folks should be too worried about that the 
  other thing.
Juan Caballero: +1 To orie's posiedon profile :D
<orie> JSON-LD Star or bust.
Manu Sporny:  Interesting I think about gordian is today when 
  like in verifiable credentials if you do already have data set 
  canonicalization what you end up with is and quads it's a list of 
  these are the nodes in the graph and it doesn't have The 
  annotation properties that wolf and Christopher or highlighting 
  in that that gordian does right already have started trying to do 
  a bit of that but being able to annotate nodes and predicate.
Manu Sporny:   Object relationships it doesn't have any of that 
  and there's nothing to say that.
Manu Sporny:  When we canonicalize like if we're in a verifiable 
  credential when we canonicalize we don't have to go to rdf right 
  we could just canonicalize rate 40 and envelope in in just to be 
  clear that what we would get out of that is it looks like the 
  envelope has structure right rdf data set canonicalization today 
  with n quads is a flat list it has no structure in fact we lose 
  this structure when we canonicalize and that.
Manu Sporny:   Makes doing things like selective disclosure.
<orie> it has structure, its a line and character delineated 
  list... which is aweful.
Manu Sporny:  Difficult like you know the BBS stuff that's going 
  on right now it's a bit more difficult to do that because in the 
  reason you need a json-ld frame is because we can't store the we 
  can't save the structure when we can analyze so it's things like 
  that that are kind of popping up as like oh this would be really 
  interesting because if we could save the structure then all of a 
  sudden selective disclosure mechanisms we would have more options 
  on what to do kind of at the cryptographic layer there did that 
  make sense.
Manu Sporny:   Sense wolf and Christopher is that like a.
Wolf_McNally: I think it's great yeah I think it's an excellent 
  thought Manu.
Christopher Allen:  Yep that's why we did this be honest.
Harrison_Tang: Oh I just want to do it quick time check I think 
  there are still a couple more questions like Christopher and wolf 
  will you be able to stay on for another five minutes.
<orie> just add a Gordion flag to canonize in jsonld.js
<orie> URDNA2015 when it left the village.
Harrison_Tang: Okay good good okay so well and in about three 
  minutes so if other people need to jump please feel free to do so 
  otherwise we will stay on for another five minutes for for the 
  remainder of the questions and next week we'll have the multi 
  sick verifiable credentials and conditional proof so put I'll 
  send out the agenda tomorrow right Keith you're next.
Keith Kowal:  Thank you it may be a basic question may be a 
  sudden I'm not following but who would be the author of the 
  gordian envelope would it be in the traditional verifiable 
  credential sense the issuer of a credential to a holder would 
  also author the gordian envelope or would it be third parties 
  that are authoring gordian envelopes or if you are missing that 
  piece.
Christopher Allen:  So obviously issuers you know if you're if 
  you've got a signature involved signatures have hashes encryption 
  has nonces times can be signatures have both both of them have 
  nonces so they will be unique in some fashion because it's signed 
  by an issue or is encrypted by somebody that being said Elysian 
  can be done by anybody you may not you may decide hey you've 
  given me something.
Christopher Allen:   Thing where all the signatures.
Christopher Allen:  But you've elided too much I'm not going to 
  accept it that is something new to our community we generally 
  don't allow holders to Allied directly we sort of indirectly 
  support it through some some of the cryptographic trips that the 
  issuer offers but in Gordon envelope everything can be alighted 
  in a in a holder three-dimensional you know degrees down the 
  issuer David to a subject.
Christopher Allen:   The subject gave it.
Christopher Allen:  See in the pharmacy gave it to the insurance 
  company insurance company could basically say Hey you know I need 
  to live some of this data because it's sensitive for me too and 
  even further alighted to the next party and all the signatures 
  will still work that does and we talked about this in the idea 
  draft mean you have to be careful about what you accept and you 
  also technically like will warn you and our apis if you try to 
  sign something that is a lighted because then you're signing.
Christopher Allen:   Something where some part of it you can.
Christopher Allen:  Know what it is but maybe you know what 
  through some other pattern and that's you're willing to sign it 
  but those are two kind of critical security sensibilities that 
  gordian has that make it a little bit different than classic.
Wolf_McNally: Yeah it was Courtney envelope it's possible to sign 
  something where you don't know what you're signing I'm not sure 
  if that's useful or not but you might want to validate that you 
  aren't signing something that has been partially alighted but we 
  have some examples in our documentation if for example a person 
  gets an educational credential which lists in detail the course 
  of courses they took and so on they Allied certain parts of that 
  just to show they have.
Wolf_McNally:  the credential but it still.
Wolf_McNally: The issuer which the signature still valid even 
  though it's partially a lighted they provide their employer the 
  employer is a contractor to another agency and they want to 
  Warrant to that agency that their that their employees have 
  certain credentials but without revealing the identity of the 
  police they allowed it further and handed on to the to the agency 
  who can then verify the the chain of signatures both from the 
  employer who signed the light envelope and from the original 
  issuing organization that has offered the credential without even 
  knowing who the person.
Wolf_McNally:  in is so yeah.
Harrison_Tang: Go up I just have a question earlier if I recall 
  correctly you mentioned that a lot of these work is supported by 
  the blockchain community so I'm just curious about how does 
  gordian envelope data structure and data model like what's its 
  use case right and how is being applied in the blockchain 
  community.
Christopher Allen:  Right now mostly about a about resilience so 
  that the first deployment of gordium so we've been using some 
  other gordian you are standards and whatever in the blogging 
  Community for animated QRS for partially sign transactions 
  through a variety of operations on Keys you know please give me a 
  public key of this derivation so that I can use it in a multisig 
  contract you know those types of things already are deployed by 
  over a dozen dozen company.
Christopher Allen:   The gordian.
Christopher Allen:  At you know.
Christopher Allen:  Sort of takes those structures and allows us 
  to do some very important resilience and Recovery things so that 
  the big project this quarter by the the gordian developer 
  Community is to do collaborative seed recovery which basically 
  means we can Shard keys in a variety way some can go an iCloud 
  some might go on a hardware ring some might go to your social 
  recovery Partners all different kinds of variants there and.
Christopher Allen:  You recover you'll not only get your seed 
  material you'll also get the other met the data that is necessary 
  because increasingly today just having the keys isn't good enough 
  you need to know you know what is the The Whisper address so the 
  partner that you know is required to co-sign something with you 
  what is the you know what is the Dynamics of the Quorum that is 
  allowed and authorized to to do something so all of those will be 
  wrapped in according envelopes.
Christopher Allen:   A lot of the.
Christopher Allen:  And we'll I'd some of that data because 
  really all you care about you know for somebody is some aspect of 
  it and because it's all you know see boar they can begin to just 
  you know rap they're made of data in Steve war and when envelope 
  is ready for the collaborative seed recovery they'll just be able 
  to drop it into an envelope and they have instant capability to 
  do chorim.
Christopher Allen:   Every thresholds and other study.
Wolf_McNally: I should mention that all that all our previous 
  work before envelope was based in determining 60 bore so we chose 
  see more quite some time ago to base our stuff on and so we have 
  a lot of specs that deal with resemble how to transmit Keys seeds 
  things like that using see borba structures and those slot right 
  in to our work on envelope which is basically another higher 
  level structure that includes all the course the the things we've 
  been talking about the Aleutian encryption proofs things like 
  that that that you know.
Wolf_McNally:  our previous work didn't include but but could.
Wolf_McNally: And you can do using structure.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you and I think we have one last 
  question from Ryan right.
Ryan Grant:  I like short meeting so I removed myself from the 
  queue.

  any last words concluding words phone from Christopher and whoa.
Wolf_McNally: Thank you so much.
Christopher Allen:  Yeah yeah thank you everybody and we have 
  lots of documentation we have videos we have a command line demo 
  that you can and if you you know and videos of how to use the 
  command lines for nine different important things that gordian 
  envelope can do and then Shannon you know worked hard to create 
  four major use cases that are progressive use cases.
Christopher Allen:   To demonstrate.
Christopher Allen:  You know everything from all I just want to 
  do a simple educational credential to oh you know you know we 
  want to take 1000 credentials and join them together and happens 
  you know heard privacy on them and prevent various kinds of Human 
  Rights abuses and such so I encourage you to take a look at the 
  use cases the videos the command line if you're interested in 
  going further and we're you know we do kind of right now it's 
  been about monthly.
Christopher Allen:   Meetings on Gordy and envelope and 
  collaborative seed recovery.

# W3C Credentials Community Group Meetings Archive

This repo contains the meeting archives for the W3C-CCG (Credentials Community Group), including transcripts based on the IRC logs and audio files for our regular meetings, ancillary material such as slide presentations, etc.

## Notes on archive process

This section descibes how the chairs archive W3C-CCG meetings, including sending the agenda, how to run the meetings, and how to publish CCG minutes transcript and audio after. This information is also use for leads and other facilitators archiving any alternative CCG meetings such as task forces and special meetings.

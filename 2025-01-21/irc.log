[2025-01-21T17:05:22.664Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Not seeing anyone which is unusual great we can move straight into the content finally I don't think there are any but does anyone have any progress or updates on ccg work items they'd like to share.
[2025-01-21T17:05:44.636Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: So there was 1 item that we wanted to discuss right my mood and Harrison.
[2025-01-21T17:05:50.181Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: And that was about the website I don't know if we're ready to share this is fully with the group yet but.
[2025-01-21T17:06:01.091Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: As the new chairs we've been looking into like you know like the tool Suite that we use in our site and everything all that that entails.
[2025-01-21T17:06:05.821Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: I think we we leak towards.
[2025-01-21T17:06:12.822Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Moving away from my current website towards the CC to towards the w3c website.
[2025-01-21T17:06:17.735Z]	<Will_Abramson>	https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/
[2025-01-21T17:06:22.316Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: I I'll just uh we currently have 2 websites right there's this website which is maintained by the w3c.

[2025-01-21T17:06:26.826Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Generated by the w3c maybe we have less control over it.
[2025-01-21T17:06:27.077Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson:  and then.
[2025-01-21T17:06:29.802Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Has another website which.
[2025-01-21T17:06:31.442Z]	<Vanessa>	present+

[2025-01-21T17:06:58.903Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Problem when we were working over this website is a problem always with websites right it's like keeping these things up to date maintaining them making sure they're in sync and currently this website that the last website that I just linked the w3c ccg.
[2025-01-21T17:07:03.817Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: It's probably beneficial because it's more editable we have more control over it but also.
[2025-01-21T17:07:04.868Z]	<Davide_Margaria>	present+
[2025-01-21T17:07:07.813Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Really out of date I don't know if it's that useful to us so.

[2025-01-21T17:07:24.100Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: The chess tends to we think we should look towards some setting this website in favor of trying to maintain just 1 website under the w3c seeing if we can get that website more up to date with like active work items stuff like that.

[2025-01-21T17:07:46.351Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Yeah just just want to ask that we also have the GitHub so the The Proposal is to uh deprecate the github.io not the GitHub uh.
[2025-01-21T17:07:57.872Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Website so uh after we do that then we'll consolidate all the content to the w3c Community website and and also the GitHub.
[2025-01-21T17:08:00.192Z]	<Mahmoud>	to make it clear we would like to keep this website: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/

We want to deprecate:

[2025-01-21T17:08:18.299Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Yeah thanks mhm yeah so we're still exploring this because obviously we we need to figure out exactly how easy it would be to for us to update this uh credentials website under the w3.org domain.
[2025-01-21T17:08:21.779Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: But we feel like that's better passports.
[2025-01-21T17:08:25.017Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson:  I just want.

[2025-01-21T17:44:04.833Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: Great um now uh just a clarification question so uh when we are doing uh the the hybrid approach with post-quantum plus traditional um.
[2025-01-21T17:44:19.358Z]	<Transcriber>	Harrison_Tang: The the the is the uh performance basically linear in other words is the let's say the generation speed uh of the hybrid approach is it just the generation speed for the.

[2025-01-21T17:48:47.513Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Signature Suite dacian te crypto Suite being developed so I believe what the status is it's kind of like.
[2025-01-21T17:48:54.490Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Stay the same for a while but it looks that a day-to-day suite for the mlds a algorithm.
[2025-01-21T17:48:56.410Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: So you know maybe.
[2025-01-21T17:48:56.610Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson:  you could.
[2025-01-21T17:49:07.944Z]	<Transcriber>	Will_Abramson: Your approach into here is a different type because it's all experimental right at least at the moment maybe at some point it would move out of this crypto Suite into his own space.

Harrison_Tang: We're good to go.
Will Abramson:  Just however welcome to today's ccg call Let It 
  Be 3 c um.
Will Abramson:   Today we're.
Will Abramson:  By Andrea is going to be presenting on 
  post-quantum cryptography for verifiable credentials.
Will Abramson:  Before I get into that I'll just run through.
Will Abramson:  The admin items so first off code code of ethics 
  and professional conduct.
Will Abramson:  Uh just treat everyone with respect let's 
  continue to make these calls and this community a welcoming 
  friendly collaborative environment for us all.
Will Abramson:   We do.
Will Abramson:  Great job but it's always good to keep that top 
  of mind.
Will Abramson:  Next IP note so anyone is welcome to participate 
  in these calls however all substantive contributions to ccg work 
  items must be members of the ccg with all IPR agreements.
Will Abramson:   Now if you have.
Will Abramson:  Any questions about that feel free to reach out 
  to any of the chairs I'll be happy to help you in the right 
  direction.
Will Abramson:  Uh brief comments so this these are recorded to 
  and transcribed through jitsi and the minutes and archive is 
  available online.
Will Abramson:  Let us know if you need help finding them.
Will Abramson:  Uh finally well not finally introductions are 
  reintroductions is anyone like to say hello to the community 
  today who hasn't said hello in a while or is it new.
Will Abramson:   You're welcome.
Will Abramson:  Welcome to jump off mutant say hi.
Will Abramson:   Good luck.
Will Abramson:  To hear from me.
Will Abramson:  Okay not hearing or seeing anyone so I will move 
  on.
Will Abramson:  Um announcements and reminders so does anyone 
  have any announcements or reminders for the community today.
Will Abramson:  Not seeing anyone which is unusual great we can 
  move straight into the content finally I don't think there are 
  any but does anyone have any progress or updates on ccg work 
  items they'd like to share.
Will Abramson:  So there was 1 item that we wanted to discuss 
  right my mood and Harrison.
Will Abramson:  And that was about the website I don't know if 
  we're ready to share this is fully with the group yet but.
Will Abramson:  As the new chairs we've been looking into like 
  you know like the tool Suite that we use in our site and 
  everything all that that entails.
Will Abramson:  I think we we leak towards.
Will Abramson:  Moving away from my current website towards the 
  CC to towards the w3c website.
Will Abramson: https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/
Will Abramson:  I I'll just uh we currently have 2 websites right 
  there's this website which is maintained by the w3c.
Will Abramson:  Generated by the w3c maybe we have less control 
  over it.
Will Abramson:   And then.
Will Abramson:  Has another website which.
Will Abramson:  I think it's here.
Will Abramson: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/
Will Abramson:  Says this website and.
Will Abramson:  Problem when we were working over this website is 
  a problem always with websites right it's like keeping these 
  things up to date maintaining them making sure they're in sync 
  and currently this website that the last website that I just 
  linked the w3c ccg.
Will Abramson:  It's probably beneficial because it's more 
  editable we have more control over it but also.
Will Abramson:  Really out of date I don't know if it's that 
  useful to us so.
Will Abramson:  The chess tends to we think we should look 
  towards some setting this website in favor of trying to maintain 
  just 1 website under the w3c seeing if we can get that website 
  more up to date with like active work items stuff like that.
Will Abramson:  So if anyone has any comments or.
Will Abramson:   Questions or.
Will Abramson:  Concerns maybe jump on the queue.
Will Abramson:  Our initial thoughts.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah just just want to ask that we also have the 
  GitHub so the The Proposal is to uh deprecate the github.io not 
  the GitHub uh.
Harrison_Tang: Website so uh after we do that then we'll 
  consolidate all the content to the w3c Community website and and 
  also the GitHub.
<mahmoud> to make it clear we would like to keep this website: 
  https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/
Will Abramson:  Yeah thanks mhm yeah so we're still exploring 
  this because obviously we we need to figure out exactly how easy 
  it would be to for us to update this uh credentials website under 
  the w3.org domain.
Will Abramson:  But we feel like that's better passports.
Will Abramson:   I just want.
Will Abramson:  Like people know where we're where we're thinking 
  of going once we have a clearer idea or probably come back to the 
  group.
Will Abramson:  Final calls for the announcements or updates 
  before we hand over to Andrea.
Kaliya Young:  Hi um the usual updates for me just so folks 
  haven't been around they hear them um we have the dead on 
  conference Africa happening in Cape Town February 18 to 20th we 
  have dice ecosystems which is just 2 days focused on and really 
  for anybody in Europe building.
Kaliya Young:  He actively building ecosystems to kind of weave 
  them together and share breath practices around that that's 
  March.
Kaliya Young:  And 5th in Zurich iiw number 40 in Mountain View.
Kaliya Young:  Saying um April.
Kaliya Young:  And then if you're doing any Fetter verse.
Kaliya Young:  Distributed social network staff Johannes and I 
  have um The fetty Forum April 1 and 2.
Will Abramson:  Great thanks Kia.
Will Abramson:  Okay not seeing anyone else oh Harrison did you.
<joe_andrieu> GAN is now Ayra
<phillip_long> Arya is the new name (from GAN)
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I just want to quickly do a preview of uh 
  what's coming so uh next week I will have a Hadrian uh to talk 
  about solid uh he came from uh Europe uh in romp and then also 
  work on the solid with team burnsley so we'll talk about solid 
  you'll be more of a Q&A format supposed to do a presentation um 
  so so that's what's coming to uh next week and then the week 
  after that we'll have uh Drummond to talk about global acceptance 
  Network I think uh they changed the name recently but I forgot 
  what that new name is and then the the week after that we'll have 
  the my Pro Rock uh to our former culture to talk about the trade 
  verify the and then lastly uh just want to uh quickly note that 
  we'll have another uh open forum and work item updates on March 
  11th so we'll.
Harrison_Tang: To the different.
Harrison_Tang: Basically uh work item uh leaders uh in about 2 3 
  weeks uh to kind of uh uh get all the updates in uh so that we 
  can um have those conversations on March 11th.
Will Abramson:  Great thanks Harrison.
Will Abramson:  With that uh over to you Andrea.
<nicola_tuveri_(tau)> :+1:
<phillip_long> Joe's spelling is correct (LOL) Ayra

Topic: <Post-Quantum Cryptography in VC - PQ and PQ/T Approaches>

Will Abramson:  Great thanks a lot thanks for that our detailed 
  presentation Harrison see you on the queue.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thank you this is a great presentation 
  so first of all if you don't mind me you share this uh uh your 
  presentation with the public list or you can just uh email it to 
  me and I can share on your behalf.
Harrison_Tang: Great um now uh just a clarification question so 
  uh when we are doing uh the the hybrid approach with post-quantum 
  plus traditional um.
Harrison_Tang: The the the is the uh performance basically linear 
  in other words is the let's say the generation speed uh of the 
  hybrid approach is it just the generation speed for the.
Harrison_Tang:  uh post.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Got it so just to clarify the does the hybrid 
  approach performance basically is the sum of the post-quantum 
  performance plus the traditional cryptography performance is that 
  is that basically linear.
Harrison_Tang: Okay got it thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Got it thank you.
Will Abramson:  Great thanks uh Greg the next.
Greg Bernstein:  I was going to ask you're using JWT but it 
  doesn't seem like there's anything that requires JWT here you 
  could just directly use.
Greg Bernstein:   H the.
Greg Bernstein:  Data Integrity approach for uh doing these and 
  add a crypto Suite like we've done with eddsa and ecdsa and.
Greg Bernstein:  Type stuff is there any particular reason to use 
  JWT here.
Will Abramson: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/di-quantum-safe/
Will Abramson:  Great thanks Greg yeah I put myself on the Queue 
  to just follow up on what Greg said I don't know if you're aware 
  Andrea but there is a.
Will Abramson:  Signature Suite dacian te crypto Suite being 
  developed so I believe what the status is it's kind of like.
Will Abramson:  Stay the same for a while but it looks that a 
  day-to-day suite for the mlds a algorithm.
Will Abramson:  So you know maybe.
Will Abramson:   You could.
Will Abramson:  Your approach into here is a different type 
  because it's all experimental right at least at the moment maybe 
  at some point it would move out of this crypto Suite into his own 
  space.
Will Abramson: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/di-quantum-safe
Will Abramson:  Uh so I dropped the link I dropped the repo as 
  well if you're interested.
Will Abramson:  Yeah because I agree it would be great to see it 
  in Dayton Integrity as well.

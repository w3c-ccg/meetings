<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Okay so let&apos;s get into it um now why are blockchains difficult to use so you know blockchains have now been around for you know well over a decade um uh some would argue even longer um they exist in the world today and they are useful things right um uh they have uh they they solve certain problems that we were not able to solve um uh before um so they&apos;re they&apos;re fundamentally like a really neat cool new technology relatively speaking um uh but there are some things that are difficult about uh blockchains um you know we were in the early days of blockchains we were thinking like oh they&apos;re going to totally take over the way we run organizations and make decisions and uh you know do ownership and you know 15 years later that hasn&apos;t necessarily uh happened but they are still in existence with massive um kind of. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-48').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-48').show()" id="48" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What makes blockchains difficult to use though like why have they not expanded to to replace databases um well 1 of the 1 of the issues um with certain blockchains is that uh they burn a lot of energy now relatively speaking you there there&apos;s a good argument that they don&apos;t um uh but um in some cases you know you look at uh these massive Farms of mining machines that eat an enormous amount of energy um and that is viewed as you know um uh a concern uh to some people um on the other side of it you know the blockchains that don&apos;t burn a lot of energy they and you end up having to stake something of value which is money and then there&apos;s an argument there that like oh well you know those things are just centralizing on uh who has money and and who doesn&apos;t and you know that sort of thing there are all kinds of hybrid mechanisms. <a id="link-48" style="display:none;" href="#48">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-183').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-183').show()" id="183" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That&apos;s an excellent question that&apos;s 1 of those that&apos;s 1 of those things where it&apos;s kind of like uh it depends on the verifier and what the verifier you know as long as aligned with you know we have mechanisms that that I think 1 of the ideal things is that to use a timestamping service you have to make sure that it&apos;s clock is aligned with other timestamping services and that&apos;s something that we would probably have to put into the protocol to make sure that um you know it is using an atomic clock um appropriately um I will assert that that&apos;s largely a s solved problem on the on the internet like since the the 90s um but it is possible to have clock skew and clock drift and it&apos;s possible to have that in a way that matters in a particular set of you know cryptographic event logs um like for example if you&apos;re doing high frequency trading you probably wouldn&apos;t be able to use witnesses that did not also have like very strongly synced um uh uh uh atomic clocks right. <a id="link-183" style="display:none;" href="#183">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-193').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-193').show()" id="193" class="information">Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Like the design of it is that they&apos;re completely free floating they&apos;re not bound to any particular domain or any particular thing that&apos;s kind of a hack to just get the system off the ground we have a central directory that people send um their operations or their events to but the idea is that those are you know 1 way to think of those so that they&apos;re just witnesses that cache the results in other people can query those witnesses to get uh a set of the logs back so instead of hosting the event log on like a web server that&apos;s you know bound to a domain any you know you could have these large directories or directory services that that cache them um that you know there&apos;s some work to be done there about how to decentralize that a little bit more and we&apos;re super out um interested in talking about that but the the kind of core of it is kind of just the scid mechanism um some of the things that have come up from that you know there&apos;s like rate limiting that would also be an issue with witnessing I would assume like how do you come up with a policy around you know. <a id="link-193" style="display:none;" href="#193">✪</a></div>

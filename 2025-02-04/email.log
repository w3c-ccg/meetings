Kaliya Young:  Sky Mastadon etc etc.
Kaliya Young:  Uh please join us it's virtual.
Kaliya Young:  And then I'll just share 1 other thing um if 
  you're in um Asia and you're interested in coming to the mosip 
  connect conference that's the modular open source identity 
  platform.
Kaliya Young:  Um reach out to me it's sort of um.
Kaliya Young:  It's it's sort of like knock on the door invite so

Kaliya Young: DID:UnConf Africa - https://didunconf.africa/
Harrison_Tang: So next week uh we'll have uh our former culture 
  micro Rock uh to talk about the verifiable traceability and AI in 
  Supply Chain management and the week after that we'll have monu 
  here to talk about verifiable credentials for First Responders 
  and then uh actually a month from now.
Harrison_Tang:  we have.
<kaliya_identity_woman> DICE Ecosystems - 
  https://lu.ma/DICEecosystems
Harrison_Tang: Same goal and team uh to talk about digital 
  credentials API uh basically allowing uh the service providers or 
  relying parties to actually access the the digital identities in 
  the Google Wallet and apple wallet.
Harrison_Tang: All right I'll send out the media agendas uh as 
  always uh you know the week before.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Internet Identity Workshop 40 - 
  https://lu.ma/DICEecosystems
<kaliya_identity_woman> actually this link - 
  https://internetidentityworkshop.com/
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda uh today 
  very excited to have Drummond uh and actually Daryl here to talk 
  about Ira uh or formerly known as Gan Global acceptance network 
  uh trust framework I think most recently we have a very long 
  Thread about uh proving or knowing whether issuers who they who 
  they claim they are and also we have a work item around uh 
  verifiable uh verifiers and issuers list uh so it's all about 
  talking about um how do you know uh the issuers and verifiers are 
  trustworthy so I think Drummond is probably 1 of the best person 
  to answer this question so if we look forward to uh.
Harrison_Tang: So drama uh the full shorts.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Virtual FediForum April 1-2 all things 
  decentralized social web - https://fediforum.org/
Drummond Reed:  I think so much Harrison and and super glad to be 
  here um uh we've actually got several of us from the IRA team 
  here um Daryl O'Donnell is the executive director of the iris 
  Association as you said Formerly Known uh and Daryl will explain 
  a little bit why um the the evolution from Global acceptance 
  Network um uh and the early work we did put in place to Ira 
  Association which is now uh uh chartered Swiss Association um and 
  we also have uh and or Castleman here from the IR Tech Team uh 
  I'm gonna actually turn it over to Daryl to do the opening 
  introductions and see um uh does it uh as his day job right now 
  um so he'll start out and uh and then we'll you know dive deeper 
  into it explain how it works and and we can go as deep as folks 
  want to go uh on the uh technical white paper we have out so 
  Daryl over to you.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Thanks Roman um I'm going to try and 
  share my screen I've I've noticed people have been typing in like 
  present plus I'm not sure if I need to do that but we shall see.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): All right folks seeing my screen now.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): All right all right I'm gonna I'm gonna 
  burn through this relatively quickly um because I really want to 
  get to the discussion uh session but I wanted to just ground 
  things a little bit by by providing you know what is IRA and why 
  are we here.
<kaliya_identity_woman> MOSIP Connect - https://connect.mosip.io/ 
  Manila Philippines - reach out to me if you are interested in 
  attending kaliya@identitywoman.net
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): 1 of the reasons that Gann Global 
  acceptance network is what it was named back early last year it 
  was a temporary name was always a temporary name but it actually 
  started to get some legs in the market so we actually moved ahead 
  with our our rebranding but the reason behind starting with Gan 
  and creating IRA.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  is that.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That we all know that you know trust is 
  absolutely plummeting especially in our digital world we have 
  seen massive investment that's not reversing the trend it's just 
  getting worse um in business risk and compliance costs continue 
  to rise and and AI is like pouring gas on the fire it has just 
  accelerating how fast um trust levels are are beginning to you 
  know to decay.

Topic: <Ayra (fka Global Acceptance Network)>

Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): What we recognize anyone in this space 
  the reason you know we meet in spaces like this at w3c and others 
  is that we know we can't solve this problem Alone um the internet 
  was not built by 1 company 1 organization it has been built by a 
  multiple parties.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  and we.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Know that if we need to work.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  um with our.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Partners with our peers our competitors 
  as well as our customers to figure out what are the next steps.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): So 1 of the things we recognized with 
  with Ira with Gan is that we know that building and sustaining 
  trust is it's fundamental to a good business.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): It's also a multi-stakeholder problem.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): So we knew we needed a forum a place to 
  to have a neutral place to meet to sort of build the network 
  effects that helped to restore and build digital Trust.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Is Ira so Ira was created out of Gan 
  that was rebranded just uh 2 and a half weeks ago um we we 
  announced that in Zurich in mid January um and we've now been 
  working towards so Ira is a global acceptance Network it is not 
  Gan anymore but people can certainly refer to us as that we're 
  finding the name is actually working quite well but what we are 
  is a community of folks that are the Trailblazers in first movers 
  the ones who when they see opportunity that needs exploring you 
  know immediately start exploring and start to see how can I use 
  this how can I actually get ahead of my competitors how can I 
  help my customers more in this space.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): This is a quick uh shot of who our 
  Founders and members are just want to give a shout out as well to 
  um the ambassadors that we have which is part of our governance 
  construct where we make sure that we're balancing corporate 
  interests with civil society with individuals um who can offset 
  the natural tendency to peer to purely pursue commercial means 
  Ira is intended to be self-sustaining over time it does have to 
  operate in a commercial way but we want to make sure that we're 
  doing the right thing for everybody and we have those ambassadors 
  are there to balance that out.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Quickly just an idea of what's behind 
  IRA and 1 of the goals we have with Ira is to have a trust Mark 
  that you know 3 to 5 years from now when you see it you'll think 
  about certain things because you'll know certain things are true 
  at that point.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Goal with individuals is you know when 
  I see the IRA trust Mark is that I'll know that the people and 
  organizations I'm working with are actually who they say they 
  are.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That when I'm dealing with 
  organizations and and for that matter people in the ira trust 
  Network that the system will just work that the wires I don't 
  have to worry about changing apis or which credential format it's 
  just going to work.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): But also when I share information that 
  the rules the business rules the governance rules will be 
  respected and I won't have to worry about people you know selling 
  my data onwards that type of thing.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): What we also want to get to the point 
  when we don't see the IRA trust market and we're doing 1 of these 
  private things 1 of these sharing things that we kind of back up 
  and and and wonder why am I doing this does this mean I'm sharing 
  information with someone who is I shouldn't trust that may not be 
  true we want to get to the point where when I don't see the trust 
  Mark I start to wonder.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): On a business level we want to make 
  sure that businesses know that it can conduct their business 
  whether that's for profit or non-profit knowing that the parties 
  involved are authentic that they actually are who they say they 
  are.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That they're following the business in 
  a governance rules that I expect.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  and also.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): I build out my business I don't have to 
  go and build the networks I need I can tap into them many 
  ecosystems already exists I think in the SSI World the whole 
  credential world we thought you know 5 years ago that you know 
  supply chain was an ecosystem sure it is but it's actually 
  comprised of hundreds or thousands of small.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Ecosystems it's how do I connect to 
  those that becomes really really hard if I'm doing it by myself 
  on my own but if they already exist I can just tap into them and 
  and add value where I can or buy things that add value to me.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): And our government bases we want to 
  make sure governments understand that we're not here to usurp 
  government we're here to support their authorities and policies 
  make sure that they understand how to how to their systems fit in 
  how do they how does Ira enable growth inside their country as 
  their country and and citizens and businesses work both inside as 
  well as with other countries that they know that their their 
  authorities and policies are respected.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That their citizens are being treated 
  well and that the businesses in their jurisdiction are playing on 
  a Level Playing Field.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Quick little diagram here and I'm going 
  to jump on quickly and then hand over to Drummond but the goal 
  behind the iris Association is to govern.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The IRA trust Network which really is 
  an ecosystem of ecosystems if we Ira are not connecting many 
  ecosystems.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Not about a single ecosystem if there's 
  only 1 ecosystem you connect to Ira we don't have a reason to 
  exist we want to make sure that as we connect that these are 
  truly interoperable.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  we want.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Have many many ecosystems for starting 
  with just a few right now but the whole goal is to make sure that 
  we can scale to many hundreds thousands or more of independent 
  and Sovereign ecosystems.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Um if you heard the announcements we 
  have a new domain as I mentioned you know Gan everything will 
  forward over if you go to gananda Foundation it just lands now at 
  Ira forum.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Our new email socials you'll find us on 
  all of these things uh LinkedIn X Blue Sky YouTube.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): And Drummond is going to dive into I 
  want to do a quick intro here.
Drummond Reed: https://ayra.forum/whitepapers/
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): But we 1 of the things we did on our 
  new website is provided a much more succinct and simple message 
  what we also provided for papers um these are intended to drive 
  depending on who you are different levels of Interest so the 
  introduction I really is about 4 to 5 pages of texts um it is 
  there to kind of give you an idea of what is it what does it mean 
  if I don't have a clue about it.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The ecosystem in ecosystems model is 
  just shy 20 Pages um it is really telling the story that many 
  have already heard and but in a particular how does Ira help 
  weigh about how do we connect ecosystems of ecosystems networks 
  of networks what's the model there.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The next 1 is about 20 Pages 20 21 
  Pages the special Network effects this is I would say um this is 
  1 of Drummond is the primary author of 1 of all of these uh the 
  tech paper is Dave and Dave Andor Andor and Dave worked on that 1 
  mostly but this paper on special Network effects if you are.
<drummond> That's Andor Kesselman and Dave Poltorak
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): If you've been involved in the 
  verifiable credentials space which this group has been this is a 
  particular importance this paper here um to the point that I've 
  actually said it could be.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): 1 of Drummond's best pieces of work.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Once you've gone through that we have a 
  much heavier technical white paper we're usually speaks to the 
  technical glue that we provide of how do we connect the 
  ecosystems.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  how do we know.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Who is in the ecosystems.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Are we connecting how are we proving 
  the connections going to work that the wires are going to 
  connect.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  that P.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Papers about I think 50 pages or so a 
  lot of uh good great detail in there but you'll see how things 
  are glued together.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That is it from me as far as intro I'm 
  going to hand back over to Drummond and Andor uh Drummond.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): And if anybody has any questions happy 
  to take them.
Drummond Reed:  So yeah let's let's actually stop any anyone who 
  has any questions right now uh for Daryl I know Daryl if you're 
  on the chat some of them might come in there um let's just pause 
  for a second to see if anyone has any questions about the overall 
  the the big picture before we dive down uh any further.
<phillip_long> You've mentioned a trust mark - you'll elaborate 
  on that?
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): I think I see Harrison or or you're 
  asking if anyone has any questions okay.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry uh yeah there's a question from Phil about 
  you mentioned trust Mark can you elaborate on that.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Yeah so the the logo you were seeing 
  their um it forms the graphical basis for for the trust mark But 
  the goal down the road is to establish a trust Mark and 
  certification program where.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): We will know that systems are Ira 
  ready.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): When they can pass both the conformance 
  test Suite which is more on the technical side.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  but all.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Also that they have agreed to the very 
  light terms that create the business and governance portion of 
  the IRA trust Network.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  so this.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Is a will become a formal trust Mark 
  certification.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): We are in time we're not doing it today 
  but with soon working to find Labs that will actually do we're 
  not going to be a certification body we're going to set the 
  conditions that say here are the specifications for the 
  certification of the trust mark That's the only spec work we're 
  working on folks we are working with folks to do specs and 
  standards.
<phillip_long> That's what I was interested in - what's behind 
  the trust mark required to 'earn it'.  Thanks!
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): But that's the goal is down the road 
  you'll be able to put that logo on software perhaps on hard 
  devices who knows.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Does that help.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah and by the way just uh uh uh a follow-up 
  question on that so do you do you do you have thoughts in regards 
  to exactly what kind of uh policies that will be in place for 
  example what kind of identity Assurance level like will you do 
  business entity verifications and so on so on.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): We are so 1 of the things we are we are 
  definitely establishing at at at the IRA level.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Ability to assert Assurance levels.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Itself is not going to be asserting 
  Assurance levels.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  but the.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Goal is that we could we can connect 
  multiple ecosystems that have a consistent way of saying this is 
  what Assurance level X means.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  and this.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): This is what's behind it here are the 
  liability and indemnity terms.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): There's the value exchange you know if 
  you're having any any liability odds are pretty good you're 
  paying for it.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Um so that we have a way of 
  communicating that individual ecosystems will have their own way 
  of saying hey this is uh um our Assurance level 1 of our Market 
  goals is to help Drive alignment on those so that we don't have 
  17,000 different Assurance levels that we have to map between 
  them.
Harrison_Tang: Got it and can you clarify uh when you say 
  ecosystem of ecosystems can you clarify an example of underlying 
  ecosystem that's like for example velocity Network which uh 
  specializing like employment screening is that is that kind of a 
  a ecosystem you're talking about in your Federate federating all 
  these ecosystems yeah.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Yeah absolutely so velocity network is 
  1 of our uh founding members.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): They're 1 of many on the workforce 
  credentialing education side so the goal is how do we connect 
  multiples of them so that a particular jurisdiction doesn't have 
  to join 17 different ecosystems in order to have Market effect 
  they can join whatever makes sense in their jurisdiction and we 
  have kind of a global education ecosystem of ecosystems.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Does that help.
Harrison_Tang: Yes thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions before we move on.
Drummond Reed:  Cool all right thank you Daryl um um Harrison 
  what I'm gonna propose now I will share my screen hopefully this 
  works uh.
Drummond Reed:  Here with uh I'm going to do like you said a 
  particular window and I'm gonna get this 1 right here and see if 
  this works.
Drummond Reed:  Looks like it's coming through yeah good all 
  right so um uh what I proposed do here is just uh use uh the 
  content of the um uh.
Drummond Reed:  Of course the Daryl mentioned earlier um to to.
Drummond Reed:   You know.
Drummond Reed:  Dive a little bit deeper into okay so how does 
  this actually work and where are we going with it um and uh and 
  then you know it's it's great I love this this group because 
  people do ask questions we get into real discussions about it um 
  we also have uh uh uh Andor here so we can dive into the uh uh.
Drummond Reed:  A white paper if if that turns out to be helpful 
  um but I I love the fact that we're already you know everyone's 
  saying hey this is all about how the governance half meets the 
  technology half um and uh and and and we're you know we're all 
  about how governance actually gets done effectively uh in an 
  ecosystem ecosystems model um so that's what I that's the paper I 
  want to start out with I'm not I'm just gonna um give you I'm 
  gonna use a couple diagrams from this paper to quickly uh or give 
  you a sense uh we have a cross links to all the other white 
  papers here I'll I'll I'll bring up the the contents so you can 
  just see that what we do here is basically for folks that you 
  know may not be as familiar as everyone on this call with what 
  digital trust ecosystems are and how they work uh we explain that 
  and then we explained and and why are we advocating ecosystem 
  ecosystems model um and why does that.
Drummond Reed:   That end up.
Drummond Reed:  With this concept of what we call clusters uh 
  which are are are ecosystems that share a common set of uh uh 
  requirements typically for a family of credentials and the 
  governance that goes with them and therefore they want to work 
  together um to create a cluster and uh in the end realize the 
  network effects of of having that uh uh common uh credential 
  definition and governance and basically uh trust um.
Drummond Reed:   Shortly I'll.
Drummond Reed:  Go to the other paper that Daryl mentioned on of 
  the special Network effects of Ira Network credentials but let's 
  just start here um I'm going to shoot down just to the uh.
Drummond Reed:  Uh um you know we use the classic diagram um.
Drummond Reed:  Making sure folks.
Drummond Reed:  Again that might be new to this.
Drummond Reed:  Very touchy the uh um scrolling here I'll just 
  get it up to that point uh that we're all familiar with in terms 
  of uh the trust triangle and and what I call the governance 
  Diamond um and the role in an ecosystem of whatever that 
  governing body might be um as you know as as large courses uh 
  government or group of governments like um the uh has um European 
  digital identity wallet um uh ecosystem um uh I'm going to say 
  everyone right now if you're looking for an example of an 
  ecosystem of ecosystems that is in development out there in the 
  real world it is the uh um European digital identity wallet 
  ecosystem um I work for uh my you know my part of my day job I 
  was working for Jen Jen is 1 of the uh leads 1 of the European um 
  Udi a large-scale Pilots.
Drummond Reed:  1 Of the work items we had there was to actually 
  map um the uh European digital identity the digital identity 
  wallet ecosystem into the trust of B model and explain how it is 
  in ecosystem of ecosystems so it really fits this model quite 
  well so do other National ecosystems like Bhutan.
Drummond Reed:  So uh anyway after explaining that we go down and 
  we say hey once we have digital credentials.
Drummond Reed:  Uh the job of of the verification software the 
  verifiers will be running everywhere has to go through these 4 
  steps they have to verify the signature on the credential they 
  got to verify that the public key actually belongs to credential 
  issuer and then the third step is where they go ah but is that 
  issuer authorized within whatever ecosystems it's it's operating 
  or the verifier uh is issue authorized to issue or is a verifier 
  authorized to verify um as you said Harrison you've got.
Drummond Reed:  Work item on verifying the verifier so you know 
  this problem quite well and then related to that course is uh 
  number 4 revocation uh which were purposed in this paper we're 
  saying that's that similar we're going to treat it as a 
  specialized uh trust registry function it can be carried out 
  various ways but primarily looking at okay how do we deal if.
Drummond Reed:  Identifiers such as dids can handle um the second 
  issue how do we deal with the Third.
Drummond Reed:  And we have a little bit of information about 
  verifiable identifiers so trust registries you know operate where 
  they fit in that some examples and then we go down to saying all 
  right.
Drummond Reed:  First thing we need uh if we're going to have 
  interoperability between a a cross these ecosystems is we need a 
  standard way to be able to talk to the trust Registries for those 
  ecosystems and that is the work that's been undertaken and Trust 
  over IP since we started it uh back in uh the uh.
Drummond Reed:  Good health pass project uh of a standardized 
  trust registry query protocol that's the trq P we see here this 
  is a diagram from the the uh trq piece back that uh points out 
  you can talk to all different kinds of bridges that work that 
  that talk to the actual underlying authoritative systems whether 
  they're open ID systems or they're um um.
Drummond Reed:  X509 based uh uh systems or or whatever they 
  might be generic bridges into into a train or or you trusted list 
  what we're trying to do with tqp is standardized.
Drummond Reed:  I uh client software uh the verification software 
  could request the verification metadata it needs regardless of 
  the type of underlying system so as long as there's a bridge of 
  that system that information would be available and the vert 
  verifier can can take care of that task.
Drummond Reed:  Um and and once you have that of course we have 
  an example of trust or a few system now you get into all right 
  well if you have that basis why do we need an ecosystem of 
  ecosystems model.
Drummond Reed:  And uh we find a lot a lot of folks when we 
  first.
Drummond Reed:  Uh you know first started talking about Gantt 
  publicly a lot of folks said well how is it like DNS how is it 
  different from DNS.
Drummond Reed:  Uh so we said hey that's what we wanted to 
  address in this paper and I think again everyone in this call I 
  assume is pretty familiar with DNS and the fact that um it is a 
  um a Federated model it's a hierarchical model um you you you 
  work your way down a tree uh through a series of requests.
Drummond Reed:  Because DNS names uh uh are hierarchical.
Drummond Reed:  And uh and that's fine obviously it's uh 
  something that says scaled um and and is powering the internet 
  today um the the security issues around DNS uh you know we've 
  been working at them for a long time and DNS SEC has made real 
  progress there um but again this is this is named to uh IP 
  address or name to uh attribute um mapping and that's what that 
  model is very effective for um the key difference though is that 
  when it comes to trust trust is not.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> typo on 
  previous slide -- most details about example.org, but final 
  hostname is www.example.com
Drummond Reed:  Can be hierarchical but it's inherently 
  heterarchical um you you have trust between uh peers as well as 
  trust that is uh hierarchical we tried to capture it here in this 
  uh uh simple illustrative diagram where you see the Red Arrows 
  you have hierarchical trust uh this might for instance be you 
  know how a model in this upper corner of how the EU um.
<andor_kesselman> good callout TallTed. Thank you for your eye. 
  Will note for fixing later
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> (that was 
  PDF page 13, I believe)
Drummond Reed:  As an ecosystem ecosystems have um eui Works 
  where you've got a a a list of of National Trust Registries or or 
  trust lists that might then um um delegate down to uh more more 
  local uh or Regional trust lists in those member states.
Drummond Reed:  At the certainly at the quote top level um or 
  across uh a network uh which is intentionally and ecosystem of 
  ecosystems because all of these are their own ecosystems.
Drummond Reed:  What you have is you have pure recognition.
Drummond Reed:  It's not delegation because all of these peers 
  just like Sovereign Nations uh do not delegate to each other they 
  recognize each other and you have diplomatic recognition which 
  you can give.
Drummond Reed:   To a country.
Drummond Reed:  Or you can withdraw from a country and that's 
  what we're representing here with these these blue lines and what 
  the trq protocol you can query a trust registry not just for what 
  um authorizations it provides within its own ecosystem but what 
  other trusts Registries it recognizes.
Drummond Reed:  And and that's that is the essence of what we 
  call the ecosystem ecosystems model.
Drummond Reed:  Um and uh the last point I'll make about this 
  paper is that uh you can see here in in perhaps this little um um 
  section that when you have a set of ecosystems that share uh a 
  common set of problems um and and you know it's endemic name any 
  industry financial services with kyc um.
Drummond Reed:  Uh the health industry with all different kinds 
  of credentials from you know vaccines to um uh different kinds of 
  of of disease information certainly travel is another common 
  example that comes up uh we could go on for quite a bit.
Drummond Reed:  We got tired of saying well those are all 
  ecosystems of ecosystems themselves so we came up with a simple 
  term we call them a cluster.
Drummond Reed:  And we believe that the way that um this this 
  network will start to evolve um uh is in the formation of 
  clusters.
Drummond Reed:  Uh and individual ecosystems will say hey we 
  really need a network effect between ourselves and and to do that 
  let's collaborate on the development of a uh a family of 
  credentials and governance for that cluster uh and and that's 
  what those ecosystems will do together so you'll have Sovereign 
  ecosystems collaborating on clusters and those clusters then can 
  collaborate on uh recognizing each other and that's what forms 
  what we call the IRA trust network uh and and we're fully 
  cognizant that there may be other um.
Drummond Reed:   Efforts uh similar to.
Drummond Reed:  Hyra we're not trying to be the only such effort.
Drummond Reed:  We're just trying.
Drummond Reed:  Trying to uh get this network effect going and 
  enable interoperability between these ecosystems.
Drummond Reed:  So I think that's the the last point I want to 
  make relative to this paper before we're going over to the 
  network credentials paper so I'm going to stop there and see are 
  there any uh any questions folks want to ask about the basic 
  model.
Harrison_Tang: Yes uh Nas.
Harrison_Tang: Join the queue.
Tom S:  Uh I'm comparatively a newbie so please don't mind if my 
  question is a little uh okay uh so the there I read the white 
  paper before the call and there was a part where uh there's a 
  mention about some of the examples of trust registry queries uh 
  where is Hospital X authorized to issue Health credential why in 
  ecosystem Z or uh basically saying that which issuer can issue 
  credentials and which verifier can verify credentials when we say 
  it in that manner there seems to be a higher controlling 
  mechanism as in I'm trying to understand who and how these rules 
  are decided uh does my question make sense.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Yep do you want me to jump in Drummond.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Yeah so this is a this is a great 
  example 1 of the things that that that kind of a Bugaboo of mine 
  is some of the decentralized world thinks that everything is 
  decentralized it's not.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  when you.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Do look to say is that a legitimate 
  Hospital.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): There is some Authority in your 
  jurisdiction that can answer that question.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): That I mean I'm from Canada that is a 
  provincial level jurisdiction.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): There are some federal military 
  hospitals but we can from Canada's perspective tell you who those 
  authorities are you can do the same in in pretty much every 
  country.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Key is how do you assess their systems 
  of record which they already maintained Hospital licensing they 
  already do all that work and then just surface that data that 
  lets you ask the question you know is that hospital authorized to 
  issue this thing under your jurisdiction.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): You know education might be an easier 1 
  to think about because less uh a little less consequential.
<andor_kesselman> Thank you for taking the time to read the 
  whiepapers Nivas.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): It's not as uh High Assurance but it's 
  you know is that a legitimate high school diploma is that a 
  legitimate degree or diploma from a higher education institution 
  you have some body that's doing that.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): On the last formal basis you may have a 
  very decentralized Network that you're tapping into to get the 
  answer to your question.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  does that.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Help lever neas.
Tom S:  Uh yeah but uh the second part of the question about 
  verifier I mean I do understand about issuer uh that there is a 
  governing body that decides who gets to issue these things but 
  why do we have this for verifier because verifier is just playing 
  a a simpler role right.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): What what what so here here's an 
  example um verifier my my hunch right now you know let's check 
  this in 5 or ten years is it to be far more common to have 
  issuers being restricted are you an issuer but there are 
  ecosystem uses that say um are you allowed to ask for that thing 
  um where you want to know who the verifiers are as an example 
  there's an operating system.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): In British Columbia.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Where the Law Society they manage the 
  list of lawyers.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Provides uh credentials that say I'm a 
  lawyer.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Currently it's restricted who can ask 
  for it because they're doing a pilot but they're limiting it to 
  access to an Evidence evidence system.
<drummond> One of the ecosystems restricting verification is the 
  EUDI Wallet ecosystem. They are requiring verifier of the PID red 
  to be verified.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Then they added in access to prisons so 
  that you can go and visit your client type of thing they're 
  really restricting the current usage of it and then probably 
  going to my guess is they're going to open that up.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra):  but you also.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Uh passports fall under this exact mode 
  that you and I as just regular folks can get information from a 
  passport but if we're a nation state we can get more information 
  from a passport that's all done through crypto I have access to 
  the decryption keys at a different level for the passport but you 
  can do similar capabilities but you don't have to limit the 
  verifiers nor do you have to limit the issuers for that matter 
  you just have to you know what is your ecosystem need.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I want.
Tom S:  Got it okay thank you thank you for that thanks I'll come 
  questions later at the end yeah.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I want to add also like in United States like 
  a lot of uh data like sensitive data is regulated so the 
  verifiers basically has to basically have permissions they have 
  to uh have some kind of identity assurance and be permissioned to 
  actually access this kind of data so for example Health Data is 1 
  famous example the other 1 is financial data yeah.
Harrison_Tang: Great you're on the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Can you hear me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay I think at least the transcriber is 
  picking up.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so I wanted to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Add to that question because it's a really 
  important 1.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where I think we've educated people that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Short Registries are important.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And now we're facing the bigger task but just 
  as important educating people why verify our Registries are 
  important.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And I think here.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We're a little restricted by the term verifier 
  because it's not actually the verifier that we're restricting 
  that we want to register.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The main tenet of main pillar of the 
  verifiable credential ecosystem is that.
<drummond> Agreed that it is the requestor -- and what they will 
  do with the verified data -- that needs protection.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Anybody can verify at any point right verify 
  early verify often so that's that's not the problem verification 
  is done cryptographically it's uh either free or really an 
  expensive that's not the problem what we need Registries for is 
  to determine who's allowed to ask you for the credential in the 
  first place right so so think of these whenever you see verify 
  registry think really request her Registries and so uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Drummond and and others um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and Daryl and and Harrison have have given 
  great examples of this so yeah I just just want to add that 
  mental substitution we see verify registry think who's allowed.
<drummond> here here to Dmitri's point. Strongly agree.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think user interface when the user is going 
  to be requested for credentials they want to know who the hell is 
  asking and are they authorized to do so okay that's it.
<joe_andrieu> That's crazy. Restricting who can request 
  information is ridiculous.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Demetri that is a really 1 of the as 
  you know 1 of the hard things we have in this industry is terms 
  what words do we use and I I really really like that term better 
  than verifier it also what about the non-credentialed.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Jar I'm I saw Joe and Joe in chat asking.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Restricting who is asking for information 
  that's ridiculous uh just want to just want to clarify uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  You are you joking there or do you really 
  believe.
Joe Andrieu:  No I I I believe it wholeheartedly I think it's it 
  is a huge flaw in a system to imagine that it's appropriate to 
  say that someone can ask for information it's a DRM Approach at 
  the censorship based approach it is different than helping 
  individuals understand who they're talking to and and what they 
  should trust them for.
Joe Andrieu:  The fact that you have the idea that someone has to 
  be authorized is absolutely contrary to the notion of Freedom 
  which allows us to take lawful actions without permission.
<harrison_tang> certain laws do restrict access to sensitive / 
  regulated data.
<dmitri_zagidulin> ah ok i get what you're saying joe
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): So so that can agree Joe on some of the 
  clarity there that you can you can provide a guidance to the user 
  that says hey someone just asked for stuff that normally is in 
  this list of allowed folks they're not do you want to share it 
  yes or no and you may make recommendations but I agree you should 
  not be stopping them I do push back that that list of who what is 
  normal who is authorized is important I do believe that.
<harrison_tang> FCRA, GLBA, ...
Harrison_Tang: All right any other questions and they'll drop me 
  you have another paper you want to share so maybe should.
<dmitri_zagidulin> so think of requestor registries not 
  /constraining/ who is allowed to request,
Drummond Reed:  Sure I I but I this is exactly the kind of uh 
  it's very rich discussion um I'll note that right now the 
  canonical example of um.
Drummond Reed:  Uh of that discussion we were just happening is 
  the the requirements in the um.
Drummond Reed:  Union digital identity wallet initiative around 
  um.
<dmitri_zagidulin> but instead helping identify (to the holder) 
  WHO is requesting
Drummond Reed:  Trustless for verifiers of of the uh personal 
  identity credentials pids um the EU is just adamant if you want 
  to request that credential you need to be um.
<dmitri_zagidulin> which is crucial
Drummond Reed:  I think at least identifiable I'm not sure if 
  authorizes the right word but you need to be registered as a 
  verifier um and I I think that adds to the transparency that will 
  then uh support I I do Joe makes a great Point uh we we didn't 
  create SSI.
Drummond Reed:  Give everyone a.
<phillip_long> So the notion of an anonymous request would be 
  either prohibited or in some way limited?  I can see the entity 
  who has received the request having  the choice of responding but 
  not they can't ask.
Drummond Reed:  Uh you know uh I want to restrict the information 
  they can share um in any case um I do want to have time to pop 
  over I'm gonna now pop over to this paper uh because I really 
  want to highlight it um as as as Daryl said I was my favorite of 
  the of the 4 papers that I have work on uh that the I highly 
  recommend anyone who wants to to dive down I will at least if we 
  run out of time I want to give a shout out.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @phil just picture that UI that pops up
Drummond Reed:  To the uh technical white paper um uh and on 
  custom and Dave whole track uh on the on the I read Tech Team um 
  have done a fantastic job uh there's a lot of meat in here it 
  goes you know down deep and and uh points to you know the real 
  interoperability uh challenges for decentralized digital trust 
  decentralized Registries at scale um so you know it's probably 
  worth a whole another call on at.
<darrell_o'donnell_(ayra)> This Special Network Effects paper 
  changed some thinking for me and I found it incredibly valuable.
Drummond Reed:   Point uh.
Drummond Reed:  Soon but um.
Drummond Reed:  Uh let me just I gotta get a you know this these 
  notices keep coming out.
Drummond Reed:   I gonna pop this.
Drummond Reed:  Out of the way.
Drummond Reed:  And uh so with this paper what I want to 
  highlight is.
Drummond Reed:  1 Of the reasons that you know.
<dmitri_zagidulin> you get a popup that says "unknown party is 
  requesting your drivers licence". would you ever say yes?
<darrell_o'donnell_(ayra)> @Phil - some systems would limit 
  anonymous requests, others wouldn't.
Drummond Reed:  Again originally got going and now Ira uh 1 of 
  the 1 of the things that we think is possible with uh uh 
  ecosystem of ecosystems uh and and and the the the network 
  capabilities is to drive Network effects um for all of the 
  participating ecosystems and and and and and some of the 
  credentials they uh um.
Drummond Reed:  Um I'm going to go straight to this they're just 
  2 key diagrams in this paper that I want to quickly highlight and 
  and explain basically as a advertisement to please go read it and 
  and and and and and comment give us feedback on it.
Drummond Reed:  Uh the first 1 really captures that as as then 
  explaining in uh an ecosystem ecosystem of ecosystems model 
  you're going to have these 3 categories of credentials you're 
  going to have credentials that are ecosystems specific and go to 
  the example I always use there when I was in Bhutan.
Drummond Reed:  I'm visiting uh The pathan Innovation forum and 
  seeing that 20 creds that the Bhutan National digital identity 
  team has so far created to support different use cases of 
  citizens interacting with the Bhutan government that is there are 
  about 1 fifth of the way through I think it's like 115 uh use 
  cases and I don't think it'll be that many credentials you get 
  reusability of some of them but I think they're going to end up 
  with at least 50 or 60 specific credentials that are needed for 
  citizen or business interaction with the Bhutan government and 
  they want to credential every 1 of those things to minimize 
  friction make it as easy as possible for Citizens and businesses 
  in Bhutan to do their business in a safe and trustworthy way with 
  the government.
Drummond Reed:  So and fishing license is probably not terribly 
  useful outside of um the Baton ecosystem however as this diagram 
  points out and and hat tip to uh Joe Spencer and John Phillips at 
  seu in Australia for for really helping us recognize that there 
  are 2 categories if you create a sort of complete 1-off 
  credential with its own semantics um that really restricts that 
  it really only will be using that ecosystem however if you look 
  at using semantics in that fishing license credential uh you know 
  such as the maybe the personal data of this required it could be 
  aligned with credentials at the cluster level or the ones that 
  we'll talk about in a minute at what we call the IRA Network 
  credential level.
Drummond Reed:  So so you can get Synergy and uh some degree of 
  interoperability between if they're if they're aligned from the 
  standpoint of semantics or governance elements.
Drummond Reed:  The cluster credentials are the ones I've been 
  talking about along where you have a group of ecosystems that say 
  we're all going to be better off if we can align on a credential 
  family in the governance that we could all use and that will give 
  us interoperability across ecosystems whether it's Finance or 
  Healthcare or travel or supply chain what whatever it might be.
Drummond Reed:  Um and and those will be developed and then and 
  then propagate through those clusters again.
Drummond Reed:  If they they could be you know cluster specific 
  there can be cluster for instance you know what what uh some of 
  the work in the educational space has been let's just go solve 
  our problem right there but as they have the opportunity to be 
  aligned with uh ecosystem specific or the iron Network 
  credentials again we we tap the ability for greater reuse and 
  interoperability to that information.
Drummond Reed:  That the IRA level uh if we can design a set of 
  credentials uh uh you know admittedly it'll be a small family a 
  very Universal credentials.
Drummond Reed:  Family would you like Network credentials could 
  be useful in any ecosystem or any cluster because they address 
  sort of fundamentals of digital trust and uh given we just have 
  10 minutes left I'm going to pop down to the other key diagram we 
  have here um page 10 which is just overview of what is the 
  initial proposal for the iron Network credential family.
Drummond Reed:  Um and not surprisingly yes organizational ID 
  credential.
Drummond Reed:  Folks know life is 1 of our uh founding uh 
  members uh they're in the business of providing these.
Drummond Reed:  Strong and Global organizational ID credential 
  based on the uh Lei legal entity identifier uh we certainly think 
  that is 1 uh you know strong pillar that can be behind uh an 
  organizational ID credential that can be used across ecosystems.
Drummond Reed:  Many cases of needing to identify that 
  organization that's why life exists was to create an identifier 
  for that and as I think most folks know they have created a 
  verifiable um credential version of that called the vlei.
Drummond Reed:  Um we believe that when it comes to trust anchors 
  it's equally important to recognize communities that are not 
  legal entities if these are strictly legal entities here um we 
  have many many forms of communities out there that are not legal 
  entities but still are um call it powerful sources of trust um 
  classic example open source projects um the uh many of the 
  standards here uh that that we've been working on are coming out 
  of different Linux Foundation projects they have uh over 900 
  projects.
Drummond Reed:  Many different open source communities inside 
  that they are great sources of trust but they're not legal 
  entities or some of them are not legal entities.
Drummond Reed:  Um and then what you see in the center here is 
  basically a proposal for surprise surprise a personhood 
  credential um the basic idea here as explained in the white paper 
  is that um when you have source of organizational Community Trust 
  they can issue what we call verifiable relationship credentials 
  uh which is literally a a credential that would that would um um 
  it's it's a signed credential that can be issued we show them 
  going in this direction but they actually be bidirectional as you 
  see down here for person to person uh that can use basically the 
  signed uh sets of pairwise DS um and uh with uh a proper trust 
  model as an individual for instance this person accumulates 
  different uh verifiable uh relationship credentials they can 
  provide a zero knowledge proof of that as a reasonably strong not 
  perfect but reasonably strong um uh personhood credential as 
  discussed.
Drummond Reed:   In the personhood.
Drummond Reed:  Credential paper that came out last August which 
  I I probably don't think I've handed out.
Drummond Reed:  More links to in my entire career I think it was 
  just a seminal piece of work any of the authors of that paper 
  that are on this call like Wendy Seltzer thank you thank you 
  thank you.
Drummond Reed:  Menu I know is here as well so anyway this is 
  this is uh uh what we're proposing uh and and uh some of us are 
  going to participate in Workshop again next week on personal 
  credentials and this is what we're going to be bringing their so 
  I'm going to stop there and realize we have 6 minutes left any 
  questions about that or uh anything else that we.
Tom S:  Uh yeah thank you so much I I want to ask my question in 
  form of a scenario so it's easier to explain what I have in mind 
  uh let's say there is a.
Tom S:  Dating app from country y uh which wants to use these 
  first person credentials.
Tom S:  They would like to verify things like age sex and 
  nationality and if if for them to be able to provide service uh 
  if the if the nation if the citizens of country X as in country X 
  doesn't want their citizens to participate in this dating app can 
  they uh have the power to exhibit that I mean I'm I I don't know 
  if I'm making sense basically there's a global dating app which 
  wants to connect all the citizens in the world uh through first 
  person credentials but there is a particular country which says 
  my citizen should not connect to this dating app um is that 
  possible technically if so what is the name of that like concept 
  behind it yeah.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): I think that's possible through 
  legislation but I don't know that you can stop it other than.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Clearly you wouldn't be able to get a 
  government sanctioned age sex.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): You would have to go in formal at that 
  point.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The government could certainly say this 
  app is illegal you know and then then thus talk to Google and 
  apple and Yankee from the App Store.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): I don't think it's a capability of this 
  network and nor do I think it should be this is more of a data 
  distribution and you know legislation be legislation.
Tom S:  Okay so then.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Does that help.
Tom S:  This would not be self Sovereign I mean am I confusing 
  Concepts basically I'm trying to see if the user who holds the 
  first person credential has the ultimate power to decide uh who 
  what all services can they access and not uh higher authority 
  would that break that rule.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): It the the the technology would not 
  break the rule.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The the the law that says dating app X 
  you shall not ask for that in this country they be breaking the 
  law just like I might go faster than the speed limit.
Tom S:  Okay okay got it yeah that helps thanks.
<drummond> source of the white papers I've been showing: 
  https://ayra.forum/whitepapers/
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I just want to add a comment like neas I 
  think there can be in the South Sovereign identity framework 
  there can be multiple trust Frameworks there can be multiple 
  Technologies you can choose to trust Anonymous uh verifier or any 
  Anonymous entity or you can choose not to do it right so I think 
  the technology enables uh decentralization and self sovereignty 
  but then at the end of the day like you have to Anchor some kind 
  of trust somewhere right I think error is presenting something 
  here yeah.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Yeah I mean you may get a different 
  Assurance level in that particular country and you may have other 
  forces that are causing you to not operate in that country you 
  know legislation your insurance providers may say hey we can't 
  get the assurances know we're we're we don't operate there but 
  there's nothing in the network itself that but I think create 
  that condition.
<andor_kesselman> Ayra isn't scoped to manage an ecosystem's 
  authorizations. This is an ecosystem controlled layer.
Tom S:  Uh sorry I have 1 last follow-up question is there a 
  possibility of scenario where the Country official gets to say 
  that a particular service provider a gets access to a sex and 
  nationality but another particular type of uh service provider 
  doesn't get access to these like I'll give a different example 
  let's say I want to launch a new cryptocurrency uh providing air 
  drops to the first 1 million users and this could challenge the 
  um the power of that particular National nationalities currency 
  so uh does that mean uh the Country official will allow uh access 
  to these in information in 1 particular scenario and not in 
  another particular scenario like can we Define these rules like 
  that.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The the the yes the governance the the 
  business and governance rules could certainly be defined that way 
  that says hey I am asking to check this under the context of.
<drummond> Yes, ecosystems are sovereign in the Ayra ecosystem of 
  ecosystems model.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Traditional Finance if I as a company 
  go in and act and then use that license if you will.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): Asking a different context I'm breaking 
  the rules.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): But we don't want to we don't want to 
  we don't want to intrude upon the sovereignty of the individual.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): The sovereignty of the nation right.
Darrell_O'Donnell_(Ayra): They they have other they have other

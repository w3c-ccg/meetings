Wayne Vaughn: Here are links to the technologies that presented 
  to CCG today. We hope other developers will use them to build 
  applications that use Lighting for payments and authentication.   
  Boltwall - Bitcoin Lightning paywall and authentication using 
  LSATs. Built with LND, Nodejs, and Typescript. 
  https://github.com/Tierion/boltwall  Boltbox - Easy to deploy and 
  manage lightning infrastructure for software developers

  https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webpayments-http-api-20160915/#introduction
Manu Sporny: Also, would like your thoughts on: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/
Christopher Allen:  Wanted to say this is 2nd in a series of 
  requirements and examples of directed capabilities technologies. 
  [scribe assist by Kaliya Young]

Buck Perley:  The community is around LSAT is really small - me 
  and a couple engineers from lighting labs. [scribe assist by

Buck Perley:  Authentication you pay a very small amount - sybil 
  resistance that proves who you are and use it as a login. [scribe 
  assist by Kaliya Young]
Buck Perley:  In chain point and the way in bolt wall is bing

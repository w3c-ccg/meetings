We hope other developers will use them to build applications that use Lighting for payments and authentication.   Boltwall - Bitcoin Lightning paywall and authentication using LSATs.

[2020-02-25T17:46:48.934Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: macaroon is going to include payment information   what is needed to get paid. and ycu can add other thing.
[2020-02-25T17:48:10.258Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: the paying of the invoice can happen totally out of band between client and server. Not from same device.
[2020-02-25T17:48:19.500Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: all that is required is that that invoice get paid.
[2020-02-25T17:48:51.543Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: if you get the pre-image gets added into the
[2020-02-25T17:49:08.161Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: you could pay for someone else and delegate.
[2020-02-25T17:49:21.013Z]	<manu>	q+ to ask about the structure of the macaroon, are they still HMACS? is it different from Tony Arcieri's versions from many years ago? How large are they?
[2020-02-25T17:49:23.134Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: this has a day's worth of access and give it to someone else.

[2020-02-25T17:52:00.567Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: there is an identifier used to build each macaroon and a format to include the payment hash in each macaroon.
[2020-02-25T17:52:34.148Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: if you are adding the pre-image even if you don't have access to lighting node. You know invoice associated with LSAT has been paid.
[2020-02-25T17:53:06.117Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: LSAT has a versioned identifier if you are storing them in a database. so you can update the serialization format

[2020-02-25T18:00:58.575Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: explore LSATs in the browser - pay for access to pokemon API
[2020-02-25T18:01:13.273Z]	<manu>	This stuff reminds me a lot of the stuff that the Coil folks are doing through the W3C Web Payments WG: https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/09/w3c-interview-coil-on-interledger-protocol-and-web-monetization/
[2020-02-25T18:01:31.042Z]	<manu>	We did attempt to define HTTP 402 a number of years ago (and failed): https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-webpayments-http-api-20160915/#introduction
[2020-02-25T18:01:46.847Z]	<manu>	Also, would like your thoughts on: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/

[2020-02-25T18:02:17.800Z]	<identitywoman>	christopher: wanted to say this is 2nd in a series of requirements and examples of directed capabilities technologies.
[2020-02-25T18:02:42.661Z]	<identitywoman>	christopher: had a question mixed use of terms authentication and authorization (We are trying to more clearly separate these in this community ).
[2020-02-25T18:03:01.155Z]	<identitywoman>	christopher: 402 ask for authentication but reply with no I'm going to authorize.
[2020-02-25T18:03:18.453Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: the community is around LSAT is really small - me and a couple engineers from lighting labs.
[2020-02-25T18:03:41.174Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: authentication you pay a very small amount - sybil resistance that proves who you are and use it as a login.
[2020-02-25T18:04:00.034Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: in chain point and the way in bolt wall is bing used is on authorization - do I have permission to submit this hash.
[2020-02-25T18:04:11.066Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: it is not being entirely separated could use both use-cases.

[2020-02-25T18:04:53.537Z]	<identitywoman>	Johnathan: question on third party validation making macaroon depends on a client-server. how to have 3rd party delegation.
[2020-02-25T18:05:33.318Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: what about using lightning using distributed KPI out of the box with lighting. Every lighting node can identify via routing tables they maintain.
[2020-02-25T18:06:07.668Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: public key associated with lighting node is like a real world ID because it is connected to payment channels.
[2020-02-25T18:06:47.264Z]	<identitywoman>	buck: 2nd caveat made by key and lighting node (Sorry this is hard to track).
[2020-02-25T18:07:13.273Z]	<identitywoman>	thank you buck for joining us for this presentation.

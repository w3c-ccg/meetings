Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hi everyone uh welcome to uh this week's w3c ccg 
  meeting uh today uh very excited to have Brian Nubble uh from 
  Blue Sky uh to talk about identity in at protocol uh so before we 
  start just want to quickly uh go over some administrative stuff 
  uh first of all just a quick reminder on the call of Patrick and 
  professional conduct I just want to make sure we have respectful 
  and constructive conversations um so we've been doing that for 
  years um but just want to do a quick reminder at the start of 
  every meeting.

Harrison_Tang: Any announcements or reminders.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2025Mar/0137.html
Manu Sporny:  Yes uh a couple um so the first um 1 is that the uh 
  voting for The verifiable credentials 20 work is underway at the 
  worldwide Web Consortium uh here's a link uh to that male that 
  went out to the mailing list um basically there are 7 
  specifications up for Global standardization vote uh at w3c uh 
  that vote will remain until halfway through this month um if you 
  are a w3c member or know of a w3c member uh please uh have them 
  go and uh vote um for those specifications um.
Manu Sporny:  That's the first item uh the second item is as a 
  result of that um there are a number of specifications that this 
  community is incubating around verifiable credentials uh that we 
  would um like to transition over to the verifiable credential 
  working group now that it's done with those 7 specifications uh 
  it has some spare bandwidth to work on some other ones um we have 
  been uh incubating uh in discussing those on weekly calls um our 
  next uh ccg work item promotion call is uh tomorrow at 11:00 am 
  Eastern uh we'll send out an agenda for that um we are.
Manu Sporny:   Going to focus.
Manu Sporny:  The verifiable credential barcode stuff uh tomorrow 
  which is putting VCS on things like driver's licenses and 
  permanent resident cards and Bert certificates and and uh uh 
  things like that um uh we'll spend a decent chunk of the call uh 
  covering those items and then we'll also do the verifiable 
  issuers and verifiers tomorrow as well David Chadwick's gonna be 
  a participating there uh and then the Friday data Integrity call 
  will focus on the uh Security review that has been uh that's 
  nearing completion at w3c on the data Integrity work um that went 
  that call went well today um as well as uh focusing on moving 
  some of the post-quantum uh signatures uh specs and the uh unlink 
  the Everlasting unlink properties of bbs4 um so that's that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you man.
Harrison_Tang: The ccg promotion call is a 8:00 AM PT every 
  Wednesday so if people want to join um please uh to join.
Harrison_Tang: All right any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Any updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right let's get to the main agenda um again uh 
  very excited to have Brian NewBo here uh from Blue Sky to talk 
  about identity in at protocol so a quick intro uh blue sky as a 
  lot of you guys know is 1 1 of the most popular decentralized 
  social networks and they use uh app protocol and uh today Brian's 
  going to talk about how they're going to how they been tackling 
  the identity problem in app protocol.
Harrison_Tang: The floor is yours.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Cool all right let's try.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Sharing my screen on Linux.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Is that working can you see slides 
  great.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Okay so I'm gonna try to keep this.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Li short and it's like kind of a high 
  level overview of uh identity in a Proto um so maybe like 15 or 
  20 minutes uh and I mostly want to leave time for conversation so 
  I'm not going to go too deep into any 1 of these kind of topics 
  I'm going to kind of give a picture of like what we're doing and 
  how everything fits together and kind of what our motivations are 
  um for our identity system um so I'll run through kind of like 
  what you know like kind of the the goals of the pro of the the 
  app prototype and then how that translated down into our use of 
  bids and handles and coming up with our own did system and then a 
  couple um future things like what we're working on later this 
  year and what some potential kind of like collaborations or other 
  things might be.

Topic: <Identity in AT Protocol>

Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): So the background is uh of blue sky is 
  uh was kind of started as a small R&D company with a contract and 
  Twitter uh many years ago there's like this long whole long story 
  of how the company was founded um uh through this like selection 
  process within Twitter and then it's spun out and then there's 
  obviously been a lot of Twitter history in the last couple years 
  so at this point we're completely.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh separate from both Twitter and uh X 
  now xai I guess uh just acquired X recently um so the the goal 
  you know kind of like the fundamental goal is like really well 
  uh.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Described in these essays by Mike maznik 
  uh uh tech journalist who's now on our board um who wrote these 
  essays about like the difficulty of content moderation kind of 
  like how impossible it is to do content moderation in the context 
  of these giant Global multinational corporations like Twitter and 
  Facebook and Reddit that have that are making trying to make 
  decisions for everyone in the world in different regions and not 
  just how difficult that is um and a proposal to switch to 
  protocols over platforms so the this uh this Knight First 
  Amendment essay was like influential on Jack dorsy and then which 
  kind of led to ponying up the money for uh Blue Sky um the team 
  you know so Jay greyber is the founder of Blue Sky kind of got 
  together a team of us uh that had background my background I 
  worked at the internet archive right before um uh blue sky for 
  about 5 years the internet archive had this series of dweb uh 
  camps and some that's so it's kind of trying to like cultivate 
  these new a new generation.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  of web Proto.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um so that's like a little bit of my 
  background other people on the team worked on earlier 
  peer-to-peer systems like secure scuttlebutt or SSB which is a 
  device to device mostly device to device uh social protocol other 
  big influences were just the web we had some recent uh there's a 
  conference a week or 2 ago that has some good talks that people 
  have have time and are interested in out Proto in general there's 
  a couple of these talks about kind of like the ethos or like the 
  design goals of the overall protocol.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  and some of the.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Are you know the traditional Tim berners 
  Lee web of documents and links and URLs uh there's a lot of a 
  pretty strong influence from these more recent generation of 
  peer-to-peer protocols none of these really broke out and got 
  very large user bases but they're pretty influential at least on 
  us so Technologies like bit torrent which was obviously has been 
  quite successful at scale scuttlebutt is a Social Web application 
  that uh and Citizen and Beaker browser were some attempts at 
  other um more like Webby content address systems and then the 
  kind of the last we we're we're ambitious we actually want to try 
  to replace and build.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Large scale global scale networks and so 
  we're pretty heavily influenced by modern web infrastructure so 
  things like uh we have Martin kupper's 1 of our technical 
  advisors he has this book designing data intensive uh 
  applications and that's like kind of like 1 of the Bibles for us 
  is like how do we actually do this with tens or hundreds of 
  millions of users uh in the protocol so that's kind of like where 
  where culturally coming at um in designing app Proto and uh some 
  of the you know so that that was kind of like the formation that 
  was kind of in the air you know 4 or 5 years ago when we were 
  coming up with the protocol and some of the kind of decisions 
  that we came up with using this these technical influences kind 
  of combined with the goals of the company some of the things we 
  came to some and not all these were planned from the beginning 1 
  pattern we've really come down to is using peer-to-peer 
  technology but using them on servers instead of trying to do them 
  entirely device to device so this is a lot of content content 
  addressable data um using cryptographic t.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  keys for Authentication.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): So you don't need.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): It doesn't doesn't have authority 
  because it came from a particular server that has Authority 
  because it's signed and verifiable.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): A big a big connection to our mission is 
  credible exit analogy we make often is to uh you know the ease 
  that people have to move email between providers or to move your 
  cell phone service between different carriers and you own your 
  phone number um so we think that credible exit credible exit is a 
  bigger idea is that as a as a kind of like political economy in 
  the network every component of the network should be 
  substitutable by a different provider uh and you don't need to 
  replace everything all at once to as much as possible you should 
  be able to swap out individual components so you should be able 
  to swap out you know the client app you're using you should be 
  able to swap out the moderation service you're using you should 
  be able to swap out.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Server that's hosting your data things 
  like that and so that kind of drives like a key a key 
  functionality of the protocol is seamless account migration it 
  needs to be possible to move your account between different 
  service providers and not have that influence your social graph 
  it shouldn't break links it shouldn't change your experience or 
  for other people and almost any ways I'd say we've pretty 
  successfully delivered on that people move their accounts within 
  the network and other people don't even realize that they've 
  moved to accounts it's like not obvious when people migrate their 
  accounts um and so this is kind of like in stacked order this 
  results in the demand to have um uh like as a design thing we put 
  when we use Urus for social graph or for references or links uh 
  we use the identity of the of accounts in the authority position 
  so we have a schema at this is like a Ayanna provisionally 
  registered URI scheme so we have the the schemas at in the 
  author.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  the section which would.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Normally be a host name.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Or network location we put an account 
  identifier which is like a person um and this case it did uh and 
  then uh uh record type or kind of a schema type and then a an 
  individual thing so you can kind of ignore the path segment the 
  key idea is that references are to other people and which server 
  they're hosted on could change so to resolve these bids as 
  another layer of its resolve the Urus we add another layer of 
  indirection and resolution which is you have to resolve the did 
  look up the uh the current hosting location and then you can kind 
  of get the data um but this is kind of 1 of The Big Ideas is the 
  protocol is this using identity in the Authority location of Uris 
  uh and it makes uh it lets you migrate around and move around um 
  without it breaking any linkage in the network.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um so we you know we're not a we're kind 
  of a Social Web company we didn't we're not really an identity 
  company uh but we've kind of come up with a bunch of identity 
  stuff along the way um early on you know we weren't like 
  committed to using dates from the start it just it's close enough 
  uh to what we needed uh and why why reinvent something so our use 
  of bids is fairly simple we basically just want a persistent 
  identifier um it's machine readable it shouldn't change because 
  it gets embedded in these URLs it's nice that it's Compact and 
  not super long and we like the modularity the idea that you can 
  swap out we can have multiple methods so we've started with just 
  these 2 methods that we use did web which is a a existing kind of 
  draft method that's quite simple it's very easy for people to 
  implement and understand and like understand the semantics of did 
  Webb for For Better or Worse it's quite it's kind of a demo um uh 
  method and then we came up with our own method dplc which I'll 
  get to a little bit later um but you know in in the future.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  we could add a.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): We could get.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Up to multiple methods we don't want to 
  support all methods we think that is not great for 
  interoperability it puts this burden of implementation on every 
  party in the network but this ability to evolve uh over time is 
  like really appealing it's 1 of the big uh appeals of this um so 
  what are how do we you know how do we decide why don't we have 10 
  methods like what are what are the things we look for when we go 
  um hunting for methods we want fast and simple resolution for 
  anyone in the network we don't think if you want to just set up a 
  little toy project on the weekend we don't want people that you 
  know provision some huge multi-terabyte blockchain uh node in a 
  network with like ongoing maintenance required it should be 
  pretty simple to just start resolving bids immediately we do you 
  know many of our services are doing thousands of data resolutions 
  per second um and so it needs to be you know it's heavily cached 
  but it needs to be simple and cheap anyone needs to be able to 
  start resolving data and get.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  did documents with like.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): With as little prior kind of preparation 
  to that process or any kind of like service um Service 
  registration or anything like that.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  uh we want.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Low marginal cost at scale we're pretty 
  ambitious we want to get the network up to tens and hundreds of 
  millions of users um so it needs to not be expensive as some 
  context you know needs to be at most pennies per user per year or 
  something like that like our hosting costs are quite low we're 
  very frugal company we own and operate our own Hardware our own 
  data centers and did did registration and updates can't be a 
  dominant cost of our infrastructure and we've we've achieved that 
  with the methods we have right now but even even like a dollar 
  for date or something would blow all of our other costs out of 
  the water and be completely unaffordable um we believe pretty 
  heavily in key rotation we don't want to Route uh we don't want 
  to Route identities in permanent.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): So we have the the methods you know did 
  web you can obviously just swap out the verifiable credentials 
  component of the did document anytime you want with the PLC it's 
  pretty easy to to swap out um components um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): And you know flexibility in Key 
  Management Key Management is like a big challenge in application 
  design and we don't want people to have to start you know start 
  with provisioning a wallet or something like that if they want to 
  take control of their identities over time that's great but it 
  needs to be easy uh for non-technical users to get started with 
  the whole system um and tying back to the beginning because we 
  used dids as the root of authority in Urus they need to be 
  they're persistent identifiers they really can't change over time 
  in some sense the did is the identity and identity is the did 
  they're like 1 to 1 so we don't have uh we don't have a mechanism 
  for redirecting 1 did to another we don't have mechanisms for 
  merging them there's a lot of other systems that try to bite that 
  off we think that maybe in the did ecosystem that that kind of 
  stuff will emerge over time but for us and our use case and that 
  Proto we don't we think it's a huge simplification for developers 
  to not have to worry about that and just have the hard constraint 
  that bids don't change.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  over time so and I.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): An account in the network is it did in 
  some sense.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): So and this is like how we use bids this 
  is an example of a did PLC do um you know our usage is pretty 
  minimal we use service registrations as part of the protocol we 
  have a couple of these IDs and types so in this case we have a 
  personal data set server here set to Morrell um this is like a 
  blue sky hosted 1 and then we have at least 1 signing key um as 
  part part of Pros as registered with the Proto fragment and we 
  support a couple different key types uh and then there's the 
  handle is registered in the also known as so we want to use we 
  want to a large degree we want our did method did PLC and we want 
  to interoperate with other uses of vids right you could imagine 
  stuffing other stuff and they also known as there could be other 
  services and verification methods in here um this is just kind of 
  like the minimum viable this is the usage that we use for app 
  Proto we're open to doing other things it's not a huge.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): There's a little bit of tension around 
  some of these other like national ID and other more um strong 
  uses of dates and identity on the in society I guess uh you know 
  we're pretty focused on pseudonymity so accounts are persistent 
  and you want to know that you're talking to the account but we 
  don't in many cases we do not want to link them to an offline 
  Identity or you know a government ID or something like that we're 
  open to that if people want to do that but we imagine that we'll 
  always be like a pretty small fraction of people uh in the 
  network will be linking their online identity to an offline 
  identity.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um the other component sorry.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): The other component of the approval 
  identity system is handles so did you can use did web and did 
  webs are you know human meaningful because they have a domain in 
  them but in general people are mostly using good PLC or and we 
  want people to be open to using did methods that are somewhat 
  opaque and machine readable but not very human friendly but you 
  need you know you need a username in the network it's pretty 
  important for Social Web applications.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): So we use domain names domain host names 
  specifically uh as Handles in the network they're human friendly 
  like you can you know they're ASCII text at least relatively 
  human friendly to most English speakers um and parts of the world 
  we don't really support ibn's yet but we're open to it we just 
  need to kind of do a security audit of what our policy around 
  what gets rendered when and what language will be um handles are 
  recognizable they can be a kind of soft form of identity 
  verification so we have you know the New York Times is in that 
  Proto Network and it's at in New York times.net or.com so you 
  know it's a at least a relatively.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Firm it's where it's not like totally 
  bulletproof but there's a fairly firm identity verification 
  between uh previously registered domains and handles and and 
  accounts in the network this doesn't work for all use cases not 
  everyone has like a really well-established domain name as an 
  identity that they can kind of verify with but it's a part of the 
  package uh handles can change over time we think that's really 
  important like the way the the username that you have in the 
  network tend to churn and change over time almost every social 
  system lets you update what your handle and username is um so 
  that wouldn't work if we were using dids as the more recognizable 
  and visible identifier.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  um and this kind.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): The same handle might be associated with 
  different accounts over time and that's not a great user 
  experience people find that a little confusing but uh mostly 
  people stick with them like relatively over relatively long 
  periods of time or if it's a more serious use case like white 
  house.gov or New York times.com they're not going to be swapping 
  around between accounts um and so handles are bidirectionally 
  verified between with it did so it did declares it back in this 
  example and also known as there's an at colon URI which has a 
  handle in it you need to then resolve the handle back to the did 
  and we support a DNS txt method and an HPS uh well known we'd 
  support both of those partially you know just to make it 
  convenient we had we didn't think 1 or the other would fit all 
  the use cases the little Annoying to have 2 methods because you 
  can have the situation where they resolved to different DS.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): It's worked out pretty well um and 
  here's the you know here's kind of visual mapping of that how.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh the handle resolution references it 
  did you then resolve the did to a did document and then the did 
  document must refer back to the DNS so doing doing before anyone 
  you know the the best practice before ever displaying a handle in 
  the network or resolving a handle you need to verify it both ways 
  um which is a little bit of extra work but it's not too bad.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um all right so did PLC is a a new did 
  method we came up with we looked we did uh my co-workers Paul and 
  Daniel at the time did like a huge survey for like weeks looking 
  through all the various uh did methods and trying to compare them 
  and didn't find 1 that we thought would meet all of our needs so 
  I'm not going to go super deep into this this could be like a 
  whole separate talk on its own uh there's specifications on the 
  PLC directory website uh so this is kind of like provisionally 
  pseudo registered uh as it did method we haven't pushed to 
  standardize it yet we're kind of open to that over time um but 
  haven't haven't had a huge amount of time uh to push on this uh 
  some of the Key Properties it's self-certifying so it has this 
  Operation Log per PLC the PLC directory itself doesn't hold any 
  key material it only receives and validates operations submitted 
  to it.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): The PLC method has a separate set of 
  keys purely for managing the did identity separate from the like 
  the app Proto signing key registered in the document itself um 
  the whole thing is auditable and forkable so people can fetch all 
  the operations that have been submitted to the directory and 
  verify them uh we have a couple ideas I'll touch on a little bit 
  of how um we could further decentralize this whole thing and 
  interested in having conversations with other people about that 
  and I'll touch on that a little bit at the end um and talk a 
  little bit about the threat model of this um so kind of like how 
  is it going you know we've got um about 30 million accounts in 
  the network almost all of them has have PLC dids I would say in 
  2023 when we were rolling this out about 2 years ago we had a few 
  um folks in the community kind of come at us uh which was great 
  and you know we had a couple we had a couple security incidents 
  with design of PLC and uh and the handle system so people got 
  like.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Aws.com as a handle somewhat famously 
  when we were not using a well-known properly uh there's still a a 
  occasionally there are some of these smaller security incidents 
  like someone got uh googie dot blog and if you capitalize the I 
  it looks like google.log and that's like a pretty good 
  impersonation attack on the system but in general there really 
  haven't since 2023 there haven't been a ton of um attacks on the 
  system 1 of the more kind of emergent ones right now is people 
  stuffing um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Bogus data or invalid data in the PLC 
  directory so submitting operations that are like valid or look 
  valid um but don't um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  you know they.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Just have data stuffed in B 64 or 
  something like that uh it's a little bit of a denial of service 
  attack um so we've over time we've you know gotten more and more 
  strict about the directory uh and we've intervened a couple times 
  to pull data out of the directory we think that that's a pretty 
  sensitive thing to do to redact or remove information from the 
  directory so every time we've done it we've kind of dumped uh we 
  maintain this log of like all of the data that's been pulled out 
  of the Live directory uh and we try to record it and justify the 
  decision and talk about why we did it um that will you know we'll 
  need more policies over over time with that but what we've 
  definitely seen is that there's been fewer fewer and fewer 
  attacks have gotten through uh in the directory so we feel like 
  it's a pretty stable robust system right now.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Common a common thing is people are 
  critical of their being a single directory that has all of this 
  it's kind of like a bottleneck or like a watering hole in the 
  system uh that bad actors could go after or that we as the 
  current operators of the directory could abuse that position of 
  authority um so this is kind of like when we when we've thought 
  through and talked to other security researchers around like 
  what's the threat model with the directory in some sense it's 
  pretty Broad and other senses it's pretty constrained because the 
  directory doesn't have any Keys it cannot manipulate any of the 
  you know I can't swap out to declare hosting locations it can't 
  swap out anything about handles um it can fully remove bids like 
  it can remove all operations and pretend that did doesn't exist 
  uh retroactively that's 1 intervention it can do so it can do 
  this kind of denial of service thing it can go in and selectively 
  remove valid operations that were submitted and that could change 
  so it can basically revert.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Did documents to a previous point in 
  time um it can reject new operations is a different kind of 
  denial of service so you could prevent someone from migrating 
  their account for example between different hosting providers or 
  prevent them from updating their handle uh there's some very 
  subtle there's like kind of a a key recovery mechanism built into 
  PLC that depends on time stamps so some keys can override can 
  submit operations that override other operations uh in this 
  somewhat complicated way and technically you can manipulate time 
  stamps with the the PLC directory time stamps operations when 
  they come in and it could mess around with clocks and that could 
  change kind of like which Fork of dispute resolution has gone 
  down uh and then it's in a position to do rate limiting and we've 
  increasingly needed to add some rate limits.
<aaron> re-order only racing updates. the did's key needs to 
  create the race
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): I'd have to double check I don't we 
  don't the the limits are generous enough that we don't for 
  instance like self um self deal like we don't give our own 
  hosting providers more rate limits than any other server and 
  we're operating at pretty large scale um with tens of millions of 
  accounts in the network um so this hasn't been that big of a deal 
  I think we're a little nervous about rate limiting and that like 
  a really sophisticated Bots Network could probably start 
  thrashing um the directory over time but at least so far it 
  hasn't hasn't really come up as a big problem.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um and then a little bit forward looking 
  like where where are we going so this you know the the identity 
  system is pretty big in it's working for us uh we're open to 
  other people using it we think that would be cool it's we try to 
  be realistic about what our goals you know our goals might not be 
  other people's goals it might not be fit for um fit for use for 
  other applications it's pretty specific to the Social Web we're 
  really trying to do these kind of pseudonymous um accounts online 
  that's what we're very focused on um 1 of our big focuses right 
  now is reducing the centralization of the PLC entity and we think 
  there's kind of both social legal approaches to that and 
  Technical approaches we could take to decentralize the central 
  directory uh so the next step for us something we're we're 
  looking to do this year is to spin out the operation and kind of 
  ownership of the PLC directory into a separate legal entity we'll 
  probably just fund that for now so in some sense it won't be 
  super super independent but we think there's a path forward to 
  that entity ending up in a consort.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): A nonprofit Foundation or something more 
  strictly independent it looks like we're probably going to have 
  it not in the United States that's the direction we're looking in 
  that um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Where you on a technical side we want to 
  do transparency logs uh on the output of the PLC a directory so 
  we have a AP like an hcp API where you can fetch um like a live 
  stream of all of the operations coming through the directory 
  right now which lets people mirror but there's no you know if the 
  directory removed and did or removed operations.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): There'd be no way to prove that if 
  someone had been consuming it they could compare and say like hey 
  this thing's missing now um but we can use existing technology 
  like the great work that the um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Have come up with particularly this kind 
  of like modern generation of transparency logs that are 
  relatively efficient and easy to operate and verify um so we're 
  pretty excited about trying to get that in as a first step and 
  then you know other the the method might evolve into more of a 
  Consortium model of like multiple servers or cross validation of 
  logs and stuff like that over time but just we think those 2 
  steps will be a pretty big Improvement in the um the 
  decentralization of the uh the directory.
<aaron> or you could publish as a AtProto repo to have 
  Transparency
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Some other things we're working on this 
  like fairly far along is being able to do account management of 
  app Proto identities and accounts in the network kind of agnostic 
  to the application so to date Blue Sky the Blue Sky social 
  applications kind of the flagship app still it's like what we as 
  the Blue Sky company um work on but increasingly people are 
  building other apps in the network so there's like I don't know 
  dozens of these other smaller um social networks and uis for the 
  Blue Sky social network like using the same data uh and it's 
  still kind of awkward because if you want to sign up for an 
  account most people go through the Blue Sky app so we're we're 
  we're deploying um a web interface to people's personal data 
  servers or personal data server or hosting services that love 
  people sign up in the network and use their identities without 
  using the Blue Sky app at all uh and so that's like uh uh small 
  but important and difficult uh kind of uh uh user um education 
  experiences like what.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  what is this experience.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Like and all that you can.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): They are not.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): But basically it opens up people using 
  the identity system of the protocol for uses other than the blue 
  blue sky micro blogging app.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): We have an an oath schema that's like 
  fairly complicated you use a lot of these kind of like uh 
  avantguard uh oath standards an rfc's that are still working 
  their way through the system uh so it's a little difficult for 
  people to get jumping on its oaf in our in the network is 
  different because there's many clients and there's many hosting 
  providers so there's not an easier obvious way to where you would 
  register a client so all the client registration is dynamic um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): And that kind of raises the stakes on 
  things like token loss because it's not a way to revoke tokens 
  across the entire network so anyways we have this like somewhat 
  complicated ooth system that we're rolling out and we'll be we'll 
  start using our off our app somewhat soon but this is like a a 
  thing that opens up using our identity system for login and 
  authentic is either off end or off Z for arbitrary other services 
  on the web uh likely this year will take at Proto to the ITF or 
  start that process of the parts of the protocol that makes sense 
  to live at the iatf which isn't the whole thing um there's other 
  components that might lift better somewhere else uh other things 
  that were like kind of just thinking about like we're pretty 
  interested in UK cans or other UK cans are uh uh off token 
  technology for doing delegated like recursively delegated um.
<bumblefudge_afk> ucan.xyz
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Authorization uh to other resource 
  servers and that we're kind of feeling some need to do something 
  in that direction and that would be still rooted in like there'd 
  be a chain of signatures coming from a did do so that's something 
  that other people might be interested in collaborating on is like 
  using verifiable credentials to generate authentication tokens um 
  we're pretty interested in fed CM uh that we haven't really dug 
  into it this is trying to integrate in the browser to to 
  automatic sign in to other applications in a browser assisted way 
  I'll touch on that in the next screen and then the last kind of 
  fuzzy category is DNS SEC around handles that just like feels 
  like something we probably should be doing um from a security 
  standpoint but also is a fairly large um kind of user experience 
  for a lot of people it might be the first time they experience 
  DNS SEC or have to set up DNS SEC on their DNS domains to do 
  their handles so we're pretty hesitant about requiring DNS SEC 
  but uh it's a conversation to have um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): And so like you know some of these kind 
  of come around to like a use you know the whole identity system 
  could be spun off and used for other applications you know you 
  could use it to log into like.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Old web kind of things or new web you 
  know new other um current generation Social Web Technologies and 
  protocols um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  it's a.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): What does that look like we're still 
  working through this is a this is a proposal from someone in our 
  developer Community this isn't something that came from the Blue 
  Sky Team but what is this form look like is it are you logging in 
  with your handle to the atmosphere are you logging in with your 
  did to the web are you logging in with your account uh we don't 
  you know it still says sign up with blue sky that gets back to 
  the account management thing where we don't want it to be we 
  don't want any part of this experience to really be branded Blue 
  Sky specific if possible.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  but what.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): What does this look.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Like and then the are people going to 
  remember to what their handle is to type it in there uh fed cm is 
  would potentially be great because it would uh have the user 
  agent the browser like assist with this so you wouldn't need to 
  enter in the name um but that's a little bit this is kind of like 
  a active uh area of design work in the in the team and in the 
  community right now it's like what these kind of Simon forms look 
  like um and that's it um so there's you know it's a whole team 
  that's gotten to this point we've talked a lot of other folks in 
  the community we have some great technical advisors um we have 
  some of this if you haven't played around with that Proto I 
  recommend taking a look um we've got some command line tools 
  there's some cool demos um working in the fire hose and stuff 
  like that so I hope.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh I hope audio is working that whole 
  time gonna.
Harrison_Tang: Yes thank you thanks Brian.
Harrison_Tang: Great any questions Aaron do you have a comment.
Harrison_Tang: On you please.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that that was great Brian thank you so much 
  for coming to the community and and and presenting all that stuff 
  as as you probably know many of us are big fans of uh blue sky 
  and the Technologies uh you know that that you're using to to 
  build it out um uh.
Manu Sporny:  So 1 of the I I think 1 of the most.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Could you 
  provide a link to the deck? .or send it to CCG mailing list?
Manu Sporny:  Uh interesting areas of collaboration like 1 of the 
  most immediate ones feels like you know you've got 30 million 
  accounts on did PLC um uh we are at the w3c you know going to 
  flow to Charter for standardizing specific dead methods and so 
  right now like did key did webs on there and there's this big 
  question mark around like the fully decentralized method right so 
  we've got I think we've we've made a conscious decision to not do 
  a blockchain based thing at w3c just because there are number of 
  w3c members that are like hostile to blockchain in any form um 
  but uh doing 1 that um it looks like did PLC or is did PLC I 
  think like it's very much on the table so um but 1 of the things 
  we don't want to do is we don't want to standardize something 
  that you know could change or needs to change or might change or 
  or whatever so I I get.
Manu Sporny:   The general.
Manu Sporny:  Um would we want to put did PLC you know on the 
  standards track or do we want to shoot for something slightly 
  different the certificate transparency log stuff.
Manu Sporny:  Something that's kind of in scope that we're trying 
  to put in scope um so it it feels like where you want the PLC to 
  go and what we are suggesting to Charter to to kind of say like 
  we'll get to this in a year it feels like that's converging so I 
  I don't know if you have any thoughts about what you would want 
  to see modified updated or changed and did PLC before we were to 
  take it standards track.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah it's a it's a great question I 
  would love to you know I'd love to get it standardized I think 
  that the timing is a little awkward where we're just like kind of 
  not if feels like it's like kind of not quite ready and we 
  haven't had enough time to to maybe push on it or really think 
  about it we have we're pretty committed at this point for like 
  did like did PLC did in the wild today we want to be remain keep 
  them backwards compatible um you know we have these 30 million 
  accounts and as described like there's not really a migration uh 
  mechanism kind of by Design so we kind of have to keep the 
  current system chugging along as it is we have some ideas about 
  like potentially you know maybe once in the history of the whole 
  method we could do some kind of uh somewhat breaking change or 
  something like that but we really want to minimize that um.
<aaron> there are two schemas alertly
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh we have a couple ideas of like 
  potential changes like maybe we made them too short and they 
  should be longer that's a little awkward with the like 
  maintaining backward um scheme is that the the length issue is 
  around like how harder it is to do Collision attacks and generate 
  um duplicate IDs and stuff like that and it's like a little bit 
  maybe we made it a little too easy for attackers to generate 
  colliding bids um in general yeah we're like really so so the 
  tension is that we want to we want to keep we need to keep the 
  current system working basically as it is today and keep it 
  backwards compatible and yet there's like some maybe some changes 
  if we were going to go standards track that like maybe it would 
  be good so maybe like PLC 2 um could be a helpful thing uh or 
  something like that um uh and I'd be happy to to talk through 
  some of that anyways it's I feel a little conflicted about it 
  basically like like it would be really great but I don't quite 
  see how to cut the path in the next like 4 months or something 
  like that so it's a little.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  sorry about.
Harrison_Tang: Money do you have a follow-up comment or question.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah no I mean you definitely don't feel bad about 
  it like you know we're we're all working as fast as we can um uh 
  and I think that's fine like I don't think that there's a there 
  isn't like a um uh a super critical timeline that we're trying to 
  hit we're just trying to create the charter so that we could 
  merge in PLC or PLC to whenever everyone feels good with it like 
  in a year so um I think that's largely the feedback we needed is 
  like we need to figure out a way to keep the door open to PLC or 
  PLC too in a year once everyone feels more comfortable kind of 
  with with where it is so so that's that's very helpful I think 
  that's all all we needed for today.
Manu Sporny:   To make.
Manu Sporny:  Make sure that.
Manu Sporny:  The charter leaves leaves space for it.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah I'll like just to make it really to 
  try to make it really explicit like we have no we have no claim 
  over like the intellectual property of it we'd really like it to 
  be as open as possible if someone else like really credible came 
  along and wanted to run the whole thing we'd probably be open to 
  that um uh and so in particular if other people are considering 
  designing similar systems we'd really be happy to talk about like 
  what we've learned from this system so like sharing that kind of 
  information definitely definitely interested and that I would 
  definitely if we could leave the door open to it being 
  standardized kind of like as it is that would be really exciting 
  and I guess the last thing to touch on is like almost right so 
  these things like adding transparency logs that won't that's like 
  an appealing great thing for us because it will not touch the 
  underlying method at all like it makes it auditable but it 
  doesn't change how clients work it doesn't change how 
  verification works it kind of doesn't change the method itself 
  it's just like an extra layer on top um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Um thanks uh if and if uh thank you for 
  facilitating and and uh I I can't keep up with the the chat so 
  um.
Harrison_Tang: No I'll monitor the chats so demetry you're next.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Related question on um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To hear your your and the team's thoughts on 
  did web VH that's the web verified history so I know that web VH.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh team has been uh talking with you a bit and 
  I'm curious what has on the blue sky team in the 80 Proto side 
  there's been any talk about uh either supporting web VH or what 
  you feel the Delta is between that and did BLC.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah the main difference is like where 
  so the main difference is that it has uh I think it's cool I 
  think it's 1 of the more most interesting did methods out there 
  um and and probably pretty fit for purpose for like a lot of 
  applications I'm not sure totally fits exactly with what we want 
  for app Proto but it's like very close and I'm really excited to 
  see other people so that's like kind of my like Vibe on it so 
  like I'm really excited to see that kind of thing being done I 
  think a key thing that makes it difficult uh at least the last 
  time I looked at it um is it has this idea that there's uh you 
  know parts of the did can change in parts are unchanging so it's 
  kind of a mashup of in my mind it's kind of a mashup of did PLC 
  and did web is like that's just like the brain I have um so it 
  has kind of a domain embedded in the did and that can change and 
  then there's a part then there's like an operation log key aspect 
  of it that doesn't change over time that's awkward for us in the 
  Urus because potentially.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  that did change.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Part is really the identity is like a 
  little split and just artsy factual use of the dids in the Urus 
  if it changes it makes all kinds of indexing and aggregation and 
  like all these other things um quite difficult uh and we've 
  really tried to avoid putting that burden on developers in the 
  protocol um so we so it's a it's a little hard to adopt kind of 
  as it is I feel like maybe if it could be.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah I don't know like maybe maybe we 
  could have a a way of using it which is like we built something 
  like did like the PLC directory on top of it that would kind of 
  like recentral it unfortunately but it would uh make it more 
  amenable to that use case or something um I'm not sure uh I do 
  feel overall that if there's right if this group if if things 
  become if a couple you know whichever did methods come out of 
  this working group and actually get standardized uh.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): A very strong signal for us to support 
  it even if it's like not a super great fit it's also you know 
  it's totally possible for us to support methods like did web VH 
  even if it doesn't quite fit so like if you move domain it would 
  be basically a new app Proto identity we could still do it it I 
  think it would be a confusing and weird user experience for 
  everyone but it's like you know it's there's no hard blocker to 
  to try to get that through um so that's that's.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): I don't know if that conveyed much 
  coherently.
Juan Caballero:  Uh yeah I was I was actually going to.
Juan Caballero:  Say something similar which is that um.
Juan Caballero:  There are a couple different did methods that 
  basically built something on top of did web because they needed 
  migration and verifiable histories.
Juan Caballero:  Um and the way you described it as maybe if the 
  sum of the shoulds were must and some of the musts were shoulds 
  um.
Juan Caballero:  C could sort of.
Juan Caballero:  Converge with web VH by having an.
Juan Caballero:   You know.
Juan Caballero:  By by the PLC deck directory spitting out a web 
  VH translation of each.
Juan Caballero:  When someone from outside asked for it or 
  something uh I I think that's.
Juan Caballero:  Uh a good goal that lot lots of people are 
  trying to figure out how to do because uh there is.
Juan Caballero:  Um you know it's like there are certain design 
  patterns that multiple did methods have.
Juan Caballero:  Followed or cribed from each other or been 
  variations on and and part of what I think uh.
Juan Caballero:  For something I've observed from this process 
  over the years is that people tend to build an identity system 
  and then writer did method that describes the system they built 
  and then when they want to do interoperability they're finding 
  the it's a did method is not always a complete API for 
  interacting with an identity system for outside of it and the the 
  commonalities between multiple successors to did web really make 
  this clear because they're all uh trying to add portability or 
  add um self verifiability of all the did docs you know like in an 
  ipfs sense like if if each did Doc contains or is named by its 
  CID that it's self verifiable um and.
Juan Caballero:  I think part of the.
Juan Caballero:  The the process weirdness here is that we're 
  trying to come up with.
Juan Caballero:  Standardization of like how to make a good did 
  method.
Juan Caballero:  It's hard to pick a feature from this death did 
  method in a feature from this did method in standardized that 
  like it's the the mixing and matching the Frankenstein is what 
  would be better to be able to do but we can't because we did 
  methods can't move quickly enough right like you can't just.
<dmitri_zagidulin> @bumble - I think did:webvh is just the 
  successor to did:web :)
Juan Caballero:  Did web but with this feature from this method 
  and this feature from that method because there will be zero 
  implementations the day it is standardized um so anyways sorry 
  all that is a roundabout way of saying um the goal is definitely 
  to give you something did PLC could converge with uh at least 
  speaking for the I don't know myself not that group um but um 
  yeah I think the the just to just to sort of.
Juan Caballero:  Riff on the idea of why did PC can't use today's 
  web VH I think the portability thing has worked a few different 
  ways over the history of did web VH which is still v0.6 right so 
  like V1 hasn't been cut yet maybe V1 would work in a way that PLC 
  could use um.
Juan Caballero:  The the the invariant part is the CID of the 
  initial did Doc wherever that was hosted and the host.
Juan Caballero:  Can be changeable.
Juan Caballero:   Or can.
Juan Caballero:  Be not on the initial you know depending on the 
  configuration of the host that first created the did um so in a 
  way you could drop the domain name.
Juan Caballero:  Have the did PLC be the the invariant the CID 
  only without the domain.
Juan Caballero:   And then.
Juan Caballero:  The you could sort of do a did PLC to get the 
  current um.
Juan Caballero:  Uh PDS and that would give you the domain that 
  you could put back in to make it a valid web VH right like the 
  see what I mean it's like it is it did PLC already has the 
  invariant part.
Juan Caballero:  Uh and that that did PLC to did what VH 
  translation could just be a matter of.
Juan Caballero:  Some domain in there.
Juan Caballero:  You know where the current the doc is hosted in 
  well known right.
Juan Caballero:  Just figure out.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah there's definitely ideas in there I 
  feel like we have a little bit of like um you know from this I I 
  think for us at things a couple things have kind of crystallized 
  around us of like.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Is the goal like decentralized for the 
  sake of decentralization or is this like credible exit.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Like strong enough like like what what 
  is driving us away from there just being big databases like 
  what's the like fundamentally why not just have some big 
  databases and like computers are really fast these days you know 
  are not super expensive computer can just have all the identities 
  in the network so why not just have like 4 or 5 of those and and 
  we're just like more I don't I'm not trying to like evangelize 
  that world view um but it's like definitely been a change of 
  thinking for us is is just having these big directories um and as 
  long as so the key question is like do we get the properties and 
  the exit and the kind of like political economy out of it that we 
  want um.
<joe_andrieu> Wow. Why decentralize? That's really a question for 
  BlueSky?
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Right so 
  first thing is what I put in the chat there is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Can we get a 
  link to that deck or can you send that uh or a copy of it to the 
  mailing list.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I'm seeing a 
  lot of stuff in what you presented here today which is the loose 
  coupling that a lot of us at least have been looking for for 
  years if not decades uh and if properly.
<bryan_newbold_(bluesky)> slides link:
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The thing 
  that will desilo all of the silos and the challenge of course is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): To find a way 
  to pay for that.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The silos 
  that exist do exist because the lock in is the thing that lets 
  them ashore their advertisers that they're going to get the 
  benefit from advertising in that Silo and that's the whole reason 
  that they lock Us in it is not because they wanted to lock Us in 
  per se they want to get the money and the way to get the money is 
  by advertising or subscribers and we're not going to pay as much 
  as the advertisers do.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And so then 
  they have to lock in the audience for the advertising.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I don't see 
  the Holy Grail quite yet but a lot of the pieces are here and if 
  you start referring to the way that it's built as loose coupling.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I think 
  you'll have a lot of people who already understand that term and 
  understand the benefit of it from the user perspective and 
  potentially from the service provider perspective I think we've 
  got to go a little ways yet to get there but it then Pro uh 
  provides a path that benefits the users because the providers 
  have to come up with the better service instead of just the lock 
  in and that better service has to stay better and continue to get 
  better so that we don't jump ship to the other 1 that's providing 
  a better service.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): A lot of 
  words to say a simple idea there you go.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah that's definitely you know trying 
  to reintroduce uh competition is definitely a big aspect um of 
  the whole thing I think I mean I don't think this was directly if 
  I interpreted your question or your comment it was mostly about 
  the overall protocol and not necessarily about the identity 
  system the like but I'll kind of answer the question because it's 
  something we think about a lot which is like okay how is this how 
  does this PLC system or the identity system kind of like fund 
  itself like the handle system doesn't need the handle system is 
  like rests on DNS and DNS has a financial sustainability kind of 
  like at least partial answer that has worked pretty well for a 
  few decades um and we don't have that for PLC I think uh and we 
  have a little bit of like different discussion within the team 
  around this though it's like who's going to pay for PLC basically 
  1 aspect of this is like at least for us at what we're doing 
  still as a startup it's like not super huge like the PLC 
  directory is just like a rounding error of costs like it's really 
  really cheap for us compared to almost anything else we run.
<aaron> the PDS operator has an incentive to mirror and fund.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  API wise.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Every other API.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Service we have.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Costs way way way more than PLC uh so 
  it's it's.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Feasible for us to subsidize a PLC 
  instance or be a member of a PLC kind of a Consortium or like 
  Fund in something that's only operating that um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): But does that work you know if the whole 
  system grows does that work and like especially around these kind 
  of like rate limiting or these other you know like security 
  attacks and stuff like that like we think we think that like 
  security the security team will cost more than operating the 
  infrastructure basically um for PLC and like 1 answer is that 
  it's just cheap enough that it's just kind of like subsidized if 
  there's enough value in the network other people will pay so this 
  is kind of the model that I would say is kind of like um let's 
  encrypt right like let's encrypt doesn't have a direct 
  sustainability thing it depends on other people like paying in or 
  contributing and I my read is like there's enough value in what 
  lets encrypt is doing that that just works there's not a lot of 
  Internet infrastructure that's in that kind of quadrant or like 
  off on the graph where it's like cheap enough and creates enough 
  value that it can get by on that model I'm kind of optimistic 
  that PLC is but there's just so few things that get there that uh 
  it's worth being skeptical of I think.
Harrison_Tang: So yeah I have a quick question on that topic in 
  regards to cost so early you mentioned that a lot of methods cost 
  like a dollar or even more so do you know roughly how much the 
  did PLC cost.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh it's a little hard to give a fall 
  like really honest answer to that question um I mean I from a 
  compute resource cost I'm pretty sure it costs less than a 
  thousand dollars a month and we're running it pretty 
  inefficiently compared to how we run a lot of things like we're 
  just running it on a cloud provider uh if we put it on a cheaper 
  Cloud you know service provider we could have the same 
  availability and uh and cost maybe a hundred dollars a month or 
  something like that like you could run the whole thing on like a 
  hundred dollars a month instance um I'm very confident of that at 
  the fall reload we have which is like thousands or tens of 
  thousands of requests per second of um read requests uh so but 
  that's like nowhere near the actual cost right so like ten 
  thousand dollars a year that's not actually what it costs by far 
  the dominant cost is like having an on call rotation um I'm in 
  the on call rotation I haven't been aged for PLC for more than a 
  year but like it's important.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Someone is there I mean this is like a.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh so giving giving like the true cost 
  is a little difficult but certainly if there are more instances 
  of it that we're mirroring from each other then each individual 1 
  wouldn't be as critical a need as much on call I guess.
Harrison_Tang: And last question 1 do you have last question or 
  comment.
Juan Caballero:  Oh yeah I was actually just gonna ask um.
Juan Caballero:  A follow-up because you mentioned 1 candidate 
  solution is to.
Juan Caballero:  Uh just call it an ID system but don't worry 
  about it being open-ended uh just have it be a federation between 
  4 Central directories or 5 um but there's already so many pdss so 
  is the idea that pdss could be self hostable but DS would be.
Juan Caballero:  Need permission Federation in that possible 
  future.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Uh I mean there's I think.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): I don't we don't we don't have like a 
  fall per proposal for what the what the kind of like set of.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Nodes would look like um but like I I I 
  most of the ideas that I I've been shooting around are not 
  permission right it's just like who would bother running it I 
  think like people get something a little more individual 
  attachment to running their own PDS or their personal data server 
  and app Proto uh and there's more that's I think more people are 
  like more motivated to do whereas I think running a PLC mirror is 
  like a purely Community play right like you're really it doesn't 
  help you it's mostly helping.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Other people uh to run 1 certain running 
  replicas of the network I would imagine anyone.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky):  you know.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Anyone with an on call of rotation in 
  the network probably is going to run a fall replica of of the PLC 
  directory but that's different from accepting operations from 
  other people um or or trying to stay in sync that way.
Juan Caballero:  Yeah and well actually I mean I should I should 
  clarify I meant like uh I would I I assumed from the way he said 
  it that there would be 4 or 5 different um.
Juan Caballero:  On ramps like blue sky wouldn't be the only 
  place to create your initial did.
Juan Caballero:  Uh and any of multiple like the in terms of who 
  would be motivated to stand up a mirror or a uh I don't know a 
  consensus node if it were if there were some sort of consensus 
  mechanism for this vdr um.
Juan Caballero:  Yeah I would I would wonder about the on-ramps 
  but just 1 last point before I forget uh in terms of whether or 
  not these are full full nodes consensus nodes on-ramps or just 
  Witnesses uh some people are talking next week at iaw about the 
  concept of witnessing and whether or not a sort of light node 
  that only exists to point out inconsistencies are forks and other 
  people's dates uh that's that's something happening at IBEW for 
  people attending next week so just wanted to put that plug in 
  because it might be relevant to this very conversation about uh.
Juan Caballero:  BLC accepts full nodes or just witness nodes.
<joe_andrieu> #NotJustSnark witness architecture == surveillance 
  archirtecture. Be careful what you wish for.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Sure yeah um I mean anyone right it's 
  permissionless that anyone can submit an operation to at least 
  our directory so if multiple people were running directories like 
  you wouldn't need permission to submissions to them um you just 
  submit it uh and so if like the Consortium model could just be I 
  don't know that the analogy I kind of make is like it's like 
  running an open DNS resolver it's like anyone can run an open DNS 
  resolver like there's no you know you don't need to be in a 
  Consortium to do that it's just like why would you um uh and 
  there's de facto it's like there's not that many that people 
  really rely on because.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): The the like relying on it is uh High 
  barrier to entry um.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): But you know the authority model is 
  different and everything in DNS so it's not an exact um analogy.
<bumblefudge_afk> @joe i got some bad news for u about todays plc
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you uh thanks a lot Brian uh I think 
  uh today we have a very good discussion and a lot of good 
  questions so thank you thanks for jumping on and leading the 
  discussion.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): Yeah thanks for having me um and you can 
  I can't remember I mean I don't know my my emails out there Brian 
  at Blue Sky web.xyz this embarrassing XYZ domain that we still 
  have um I think if you if you also just like Google my name you 
  can find my website and my personal email I'm happy to follow up 
  and chat more about this.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks a lot.
Harrison_Tang: This concludes that this week's ccg meeting.
Aaron: If you need an audit log you just put them all in and that 
  repo that protocol.
Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): It's true I'm actually like pretty 
  interested in people having.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="information">Bryan_Newbold_(Bluesky): A big a big connection to our mission is credible exit analogy we make often is to uh you know the ease that people have to move email between providers or to move your cell phone service between different carriers and you own your phone number um so we think that credible exit credible exit is a bigger idea is that as a as a kind of like political economy in the network every component of the network should be substitutable by a different provider uh and you don&apos;t need to replace everything all at once to as much as possible you should be able to swap out individual components so you should be able to swap out you know the client app you&apos;re using you should be able to swap out the moderation service you&apos;re using you should be able to swap out. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

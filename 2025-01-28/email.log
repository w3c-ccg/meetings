Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Hello everyone so welcome to this week's w3c ccg 
  meeting uh today we're very excited to have Hedren uh from in Rob 
  and uh solid and Apache software Foundation as well as uh Aaron 
  um.
Harrison_Tang: Uh the culture of the linked web storage uh group 
  w3c link web storage group uh here to talk about the latest 
  developments on solid decentralized uh data stores uh but before 
  we get into the main agenda I just want to quickly go through 
  the.
Harrison_Tang: Of ethics and professional conduct reminder um 
  just want to make sure we have constructive and respectful 
  conversation.
Harrison_Tang: All right a quick note on the intellectual 
  property notes um anyone can participate in these calls however 
  all substantive contributions to any ccg work items must be 
  members of the ccg with full IPR agreements signed if you have 
  any questions about the w3c account or the w3c community 
  contributor license agreement uh please feel free to reach out to 
  any of the cultures.
Harrison_Tang: Are these meetings are automatically recorded and 
  transcribed and we will publish the meeting minutes the audio and 
  video recording in the next uh day or 2.
Harrison_Tang:  we use.
Harrison_Tang: Gigi chat uh to to the speakers during the call to 
  end to take minutes and you can type in Q Plus or Q minus uh to 
  uh remove from your phone the queue and you can type in Q 
  question mark to see who is in the queue.
Harrison_Tang: Right I just want to take a quick moment for the 
  introductions and reintroduction so if you're new to the 
  community or you haven't been active and want to re-engage uh 
  please feel free to just unmute and uh introduce yourself a 
  little bit.
Harrison_Tang: Just want to take a moment for the announcements 
  and reminders so if you is if there's any new announcements uh 
  feel free to just type in Q Plus or on mute.
Greg Bernstein:  I just wanted to let folks know that um for 
  privacy preserving uh forms of credentials um particularly like 
  the BBS crypto so we we've got some additional features that have 
  advanced to working group documents over at The cryptographic 
  Forum research group The CFR of the ietf so that's pseudonyms 
  which we all want to uh give us limited linkability so we can 
  kind of be remembered but not too much and uh some extra security 
  features and which go under blind BBS so those have advanced to 
  work group status we also have.
Greg Bernstein:  For that at the CFR we have public GitHub repos 
  where people can now post issues and such like that so I'll put.
Greg Bernstein:  Send out an email to the ccg with all those 
  links um.
Greg Bernstein:  I will be adding more explanatory texts to both 
  those documents uh the more you want to see and example of cases 
  so we're making progress we're going to get this nailed down so 
  we can get the BBS spec out.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thanks Greg.
Harrison_Tang: And by the way uh we had Greg uh here and present 
  about BBS plus uh in the in the last few months uh so you can 
  just search in your email inbox if you are subscribed to the 
  email list uh for Greg uh and then it's the emails from me to see 
  the recordings or if you uh cannot find the recording just reach 
  out to me because uh it is a must-watch sessions because I think 
  Greg has done a very good job explaining what BBS plus and 
  commitment schemes and all these things uh so thanks Greg.
Harrison_Tang: All right any other announcements or reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Uh any updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: I just preview uh what's coming so next week we'll 
  have uh Drummond here to talk about uh what used to be called 
  Global acceptance network uh trust framework now I think it's 
  called era IRA.
Harrison_Tang: And anyway if I mispronounced it I apologize for 
  that uh and then the week after that we have uh Mike porok uh our 
  former culture to talk about trade verified.
Harrison_Tang: Uh verifiable traceability and AI in Supply Chain 
  management.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh last calls for introductions 
  reintroductions announcements or work item related.

Topic: <Updates on Solid and Decentralized Data Stores>

Harrison_Tang: Great well let's get to the main agenda so again 
  uh very very happy here to have a Hadrian and Aaron here uh to.
Harrison_Tang: Some updates on the solid and decentralized data 
  source.
Harrison_Tang:  so Aaron.
Harrison_Tang: You want to take it away actually if you don't 
  mind just introduce yourself a little bit and uh as well as the 
  your work whether it's at in rump or the w3c uh link web storage 
  group.
Aaron Coburn:  Thanks Harrison um.
Aaron Coburn:  So I will start off by just introducing myself I'm 
  Aaron Coburn um along with hadrien I work at inrupt um I'm 1 of 
  the co-chairs of.

Topic: <Updates on Solid and Decentralized Data Stores>

Aaron Coburn:  The w3c linked web storage working group this is a 
  working group that was started um September of last year so I'll 
  get into some of the time frame that we have for this but we've 
  um we're still in a sense getting getting ramped up um in the 
  working group and um before starting with the working group I've 
  I've I've been involved in the solid world for.
Aaron Coburn:  567 Years um even before I came to interruptus so 
  I've worked on implementations I've worked on specifications so 
  I've seen kind of a broad range of of the issues that relate to 
  this this uh this space.
Aaron Coburn:  Let me just um jump into I have a couple of 
  slides.
Aaron Coburn:  Um there should be fairly quick I want to jump on 
  Hedren's toes here um so.
Aaron Coburn:  Uh link web storage it's uh working group we've 
  got um a number of people who meet uh we meet every week um on 
  Mondays and I'll get into the some of the you know how you can 
  participate.
Aaron Coburn:  Really the high-level goals here have to do with 
  web-based permission data storage.
Aaron Coburn:  Um secondarily um interoperability across this 
  shared storage using different applications.
Aaron Coburn:  Decentralization can be a part of this but it's 
  not necessarily a part of this so I just want to make it clear 
  that.
Aaron Coburn:  For some people decentralization is really key 
  when they talk about solid but it's not necessarily a um it's not 
  necessarily part of solid.
Aaron Coburn:  Or is it necessary part of uh the lws working 
  group that may be where we go and and I think we're going to 
  largely be pulling uh from technologies that come out of the 
  decentralization space but um just kind of keep in mind that some 
  of you know based on the charter based on where things currently 
  stand those are really some of the high level goals.
Aaron Coburn:  Um we're still in the in the um process of of.
Aaron Coburn:  Curating use cases and and during uh requirements 
  but some of the high-level requirements that most certainly are 
  going to be front and center for this working group involved 
  Global identifiers for entities and that's not just uh data that 
  you put in your storage but agents uh applications other kinds of 
  entities that that work in that ecosystem.
Aaron Coburn:  Secondly um Global semantics for application 
  interoperability so like I said in the high level goals 1 of the 
  key things here is making sure that you can have you can separate 
  data from Storage I'm sorry you can separate data from 
  applications such that you have different applications working on 
  the same data and interoperability.
Aaron Coburn:  That kind of is the goal there is really how can 
  you how can you help individuals or agents generally.
Aaron Coburn:  Become too tied to a particular application or 
  ensure that the that the application that that data isn't too 
  tied to a particular application.
Aaron Coburn:  That's where that interoperability comes in and 
  thirdly and this is going to be really critical for um the link 
  web storage and I think is where this is where a lot of the 
  overlap with this group comes in is having mechanisms for 
  controlling access this is both um authorization and 
  authentication but.
Aaron Coburn:  We don't have.
Aaron Coburn:  If we don't have this mechanism.
Aaron Coburn:  It's really hard to it's really hard to to look at 
  this about you know in terms of how you can share data how you 
  can work with data across different apps with in different 
  domains with different security profiles.
Aaron Coburn:  Um the current status we uh we were chartered in 
  uh um.
Aaron Coburn:  September of last year so we're chartered through 
  2026 um at the moment we're uh we've been collecting use cases 
  where in the in the process of refining those use cases so that 
  we can derive very specific requirements um and then you know 
  we'll be prioritizing those requirements.
Aaron Coburn:  Clearly based on the use cases not everything is 
  going to be um is going to make it into the spec um so there will 
  be some cutting that has to happen but some of the main things 
  that will be part of this relate to Identity.
Aaron Coburn:  I'm putting in with identity um.
Aaron Coburn:  Because there's just so much overlap there but 
  identity broadly.
Aaron Coburn:  Authorization and then uh ultimately a protocol 
  that defines this.
Aaron Coburn:  This is my last slide um.
Aaron Coburn:  So we meet weekly on Mondays at uh 10:00 a.m. 
  eastern time.
Aaron Coburn:  So the timing always uh aligns with Boston time so 
  you know.
Aaron Coburn:  When there's a time a time change that's that's 
  what we're we're pinned to um participation is open to all w3c 
  members just like any other uh working group.
Aaron Coburn:  There's a link here I can paste this into the chat 
  in just a moment um has more information about joining um and 
  about the the calendar obviously the minutes are all public so 
  anyone can can access those.
Aaron Coburn:  Um the other.
Aaron Coburn:  Thing I wanted to mention is that everyone is 
  welcome to contribute and discuss all of our use cases which are 
  currently in that first uh repository that first GitHub 
  repository lws.
Aaron Coburn:   A lot.
Aaron Coburn:  Of the eventual work will go into the lws protocol 
  repository but so far that's pretty empty we haven't we just 
  haven't gotten to the point where we were ready to start their.
Aaron Coburn:  That is all that I have so.
Aaron Coburn:  Happy to open it up for questions.
Aaron Coburn:  Um or to move into the next stage.
Harrison_Tang: Sounds good well before we get to the questions 
  and by the way I prepared a couple questions and if people other 
  people have questions feel free to just type in Q Plus uh to add 
  yourself to the queue but before we get to that Hadrian do you 
  mind kind of uh do a quick quick introductions about yourself 
  that would be great.
Hadrian: Uh sure and thanks Harrison for uh inviting us uh it's a 
  pleasure to uh talk to you I don't know much about the ccg group 
  although I recognize quite a few names in the audience right now 
  uh some of them for from the IBEW crowd um I work for indrop for 
  a bit over 2 years but and you mentioned that um Aaron works 
  there as well but funny enough uh actually Aaron and I bumped uh 
  into each other a long time ago because we're both committees at 
  the Apes of the foundation um Aaron on Jenna if anybody is 
  interested so turns out that we know each other for quite a 
  while.
Hadrian: Um and I came with a different background I was um.
Hadrian: Uh working for a while with dog SS at uh customer 
  comments and that's really how I got to be a user of sorts and 
  observer of uh solid.
Hadrian: We had many discussions about that and I'm sure some of 
  you are aware of those.
<aaron_coburn> Some links from my presentation: Linked Web 
  Storage WG: https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/lws/
Hadrian: And there was some frustration that solid is not 
  progressing well enough and kind of by accident I ended up 
  working for for interrupt.
Hadrian: And I'm very happy that we're making quite a bit of 
  progress and I hope this uh solid idea will will catch up.
Hadrian: Um can I share some slides uh.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah of course thank you.
Hadrian: Okay so let's see if I can share my screen.
Hadrian: Can you see my screen I think you can.
Hadrian: So I adapted some old slice there's not much and I'm 
  going to Echo something that Aaron said but a bit from a 
  different perspective because solid is actually not very easy to 
  explain it's pretty fundamental and it's very hard to explain 
  until you start using it and then it becomes kind of obvious um.
Hadrian: Yes so you probably know that uh team is the author of 
  solid he started it around 20145 and he incubated at MIT and then 
  it became a community group at w3c uh in the last part of the 
  decade and then um he started being dropped to create uh he's 1 
  of the co-founders to uh um create commercial products and foster 
  adoption and last year is Aaron said the lws uh group was created 
  uh because uh community group cannot issue a final recommendation 
  w3c as you know so lws is probably the Final Phase in getting 
  this specification uh to become a real standard w3c final 
  recommendation and the motivations for for doing this for team 
  initially were the fact that.
Hadrian: The web is good and adopted as it was it wasn't really 
  writable right so he talks a lot about web 3 as you probably know 
  um but the web 1.0 did not it was only read only and it was 
  actually great it was very simple it got adopted but it wasn't 
  writable.
Hadrian:  you could.
Hadrian: Right with your own tools in the back end the famous 
  Pepe web server public HTML you probably know all that then tools 
  uh came about and all that but.
Hadrian: From the web it wasn't really writable.
Hadrian: Because it didn't handle identities for instance that's 
  what that was 1 of the main blockers so anyway we have to uh all 
  came around.
Hadrian: And then uh.
Hadrian: What team calls web 3.0 uh always emphasized uh not to 
  be confused for web 3 the uh blockchain world.
Hadrian: You see on the slides that some of the frustrations came 
  from the stagnating and all that however the more important um.
Hadrian: Path for me was my work with doctors and they work on 
  the intention economy which is if you want kind of a practical 
  application uh of the technology in the sense that in order for 
  people to engage in economic transactions or any kind of 
  transactions socials transactions and all um they have to 
  exchange data and data has to reside somewhere and right now 
  because of communication issues the easiest way to exchange data 
  is being on the same platform because exchanging data outside 
  platforms requires protocols which don't really quite.
Hadrian: Exist there are some but uh nothing um.
Hadrian: Globally accepted and um that led to the idea.
Hadrian: And and by the way um.
Hadrian: Last time as far as I know team and Doc met was a Web 
  Camp 2 years ago and actually team said that solid was impart 
  inspired by Doc's ideas and his uh intention economy or portray 
  Manifesto uh 1 of the books.
Hadrian: So as I said slowly this kind of hard to explain.
Hadrian: So what it does it tries to separate data uh from 
  applications and from identities as Aaron already mentioned.
Hadrian: It's a bit subtle I don't know if I have a slide for 
  that.
Hadrian: Yes it's this 1 so today the way applications are built 
  is to have a front end and have the back end and the front end 
  has some if you want more or less unlimited access to the back 
  end and they are very tightly coupled.
Hadrian: Solid proposes a turned around sort of model that 
  decouples uh applications from.
Hadrian: Um data allowing data to be stored in if you want this 
  Universal data storage.
Hadrian: Solid calls them ports.
Hadrian: And then from their data being shared with.
Hadrian: Applications and other entities so that these parts 
  become.
Hadrian: If you want a distributed decentralized back end for any 
  kind of application.
Hadrian: And if anything that's what I would like you to retain 
  from today's presentation because it has massive implications on 
  a lot of things for me most importantly is cost because.
Hadrian: The way things are done today it's very costly for 
  applications to be built and more importantly maintained at scale 
  um.
Hadrian: Aaron can tell you that uh indras largest customer is 
  the government of Belgium of Flanders that provides a pod to 
  every citizen and I think what they realized is that if you have 
  data.
Hadrian: Citizens own support and the part and they have their 
  data in the Pod then there is no need for data exchanges between 
  different government agencies and all that because all the data 
  is in that reflects the relationship between the government and 
  the citizen is in that part and the only need thing they need to 
  build now is new uh applications to add more data and benefit 
  from the existing data so.
Hadrian: That's a very interesting model that I hope you're going 
  to think more about and as I said if anything I would like this 
  to be the conclusion of this uh conversation um.
Hadrian: I think I'm gonna stop here there are some basic things 
  here.
Hadrian: Um Harrison said that I we should expect this 
  conversation to become quite Technical and uh well that's in part 
  why aren't here because it's way more technical than me um so.
Hadrian: I think we should open up the rest of the time for for 
  questions uh Harrison what do you think.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah that would be great um let me uh ask a 
  clarification question uh is what is the difference between 
  decentralized data stores versus like link web storage or is it 
  uh basically synonyms that means the same thing.
Hadrian: You mean linked web storage is the name of the group.
Harrison_Tang: Uh link web storage and decentralized data store 
  yeah like is there a difference or we're using these terms like 
  interchangeably yeah.
Hadrian: So I should let Aaron take it but linked web storage is 
  the name of the work group at uh.
Hadrian: W3c I don't think we use it.
<kaliya_identity_woman> Decentralized Web Node
Hadrian: Different contexts whereas decentralized data store is a 
  general concept uh.
Hadrian: Please correct me if you have a different View.
Aaron Coburn:  Sure some of this I think comes from the history 
  of solid um.
Aaron Coburn:  Historically solid was built on um.
Aaron Coburn:  A protocol called um linked um the linked data 
  platform ldp.
Aaron Coburn:  Ldp itself is not particularly.
Aaron Coburn:  Well it's not particularly decentralized at all.
Aaron Coburn:  That's the first thing.
Aaron Coburn:  I don't think that decentralization really had any 
  had much to much of a role in the development of ldp.
Aaron Coburn:  A solid background really is more in the linked 
  data sphere.
Aaron Coburn:   Like I said.
Aaron Coburn:  There are ways of approaching solid from a 
  decentralized perspective and you can you can you can certainly 
  build solid as a decentralized system but it's not necessarily 
  the case that all solid systems or all systems that come out of 
  the linked web storage Community you know working group will 
  necessarily be decentralized.
Aaron Coburn:  What we tend to find even in in interrupt.
Aaron Coburn:  This is especially the case for um the instance 
  that hadrien mentioned with uh the government of Flanders or 
  Belgium is there's more of a Federated model that's actually that 
  tends to be more of an of of the interest um for you know for 
  like large Enterprises for governments.
Aaron Coburn:  They need to they need to have a governance model 
  that makes sense to them so.
Aaron Coburn:  Not so much decentralized necessarily but it can 
  be decentralized in the sense that you can have you can have data 
  all over the web you can have you can have lots of different pods 
  you can have your.
Aaron Coburn:  User identity decoupled you can have like 
  everything can be decoupled but it's um.
Aaron Coburn:  But it's not necessarily the case that it's 
  decoupled.
Harrison_Tang: Got it Dmitry you're in the queue.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Hi Adrian I just wanted to add a couple more 
  words.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh specifically to to Harrison's question on 
  so we have this vague notion of decentralized data storage where 
  does solid fit in in that landscape.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the the thing that it's really important 
  to think about with data storage is less centralized and 
  decentralized and more storing public data versus storing 
  permissions data and there's a pretty fundamental divide in.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In let's say.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Blockchain world or any sort of decentralized 
  world.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Fundamental bi.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Side all data storage.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Eventually is divided into either we're 
  dealing with public only data right so that's ipfs for example 
  many of you are familiar with ipfs internet interplanetary file 
  system uh similar projects built on it like ceramic and some 
  others and in general we've seen a number of protocols that are 
  like okay you know what permissioned data storage is hard we're 
  going to focus on public data right so for example the that 
  project dat which I think.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh well.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Protocol I I forget what it got renamed to but 
  it got started with we have public data sets from big science 
  right so we've got like terabytes and petabytes of data how do we 
  store them efficiently in a decentralized way but it's all public 
  data.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So so that's that's 1 major category of of 
  writing and retrieving public data.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then the other 1 is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and and the divide with permission to data 
  storage is essentially it goes like this.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's a number of people who believe that 
  you can ensure permission storage with encryption alone.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Those are um the number of projects that are 
  like we can do permission to storage on untrusted nodes meaning 
  anybody could spin up a storage node and we're gonna we're gonna 
  ensure Access Control via encryption alone.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the other half of that divide says no 
  encryption on can never be sufficient because all encryption has 
  a half-life you're essentially just temporarily storing data 
  until it becomes public.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So we're solid Falls in is and where how it 
  fits into the decentralized landscape is there's going to be some 
  some cases that deal with public data that can be fundamentally 
  decentralized.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some cases that are low enough threat that you 
  can say oh yeah yeah we're going to encrypt them but really it's 
  it's temporarily uh encrypted until it becomes public.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's a number of cases where you want the 
  data to be private and that means.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Encryption with permission to access control 
  and that's where solid solidly fits in it's it's exactly for 
  those applications where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Can still be.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Centralized you can still be decentralized you 
  can still be a network of nodes where you storing and reading 
  stuff from.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   But those.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Notes have to be trusted those notes have to 
  be able to enforce the access control the authorization part of 
  the protocol so hopefully that uh puts it a bit more into 
  perspective.
Harrison_Tang: Ted you have a comment.
Hadrian: No I just wanted to say that for those who are not aware 
  Demitri is 1 of the original parents of uh solid at MIT.
Harrison_Tang: I did know that.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There are a 
  lot.
Harrison_Tang: That's cool I feel like I know demetry for a long 
  time but I didn't know that fact so amazing.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's not just 
  a couple.
Hadrian: So yeah so and uh in SWS now we start we are probably 
  starting to discuss deeds and deity actually showed uh solid 
  working with uh did web I think quite a while ago so FYI Demetri.
Hadrian: So uh go ahead that sorry.
<dmitri_zagidulin> haha thanks Hadrian :)
Harrison_Tang: So just to sorry uh just to summarize a demetry 
  your comment so you're saying that a solid positioning and uh 
  unique value proposition is on permission uh storing permission 
  private data in the decentralized way versus like ipfs is focused 
  on public data is that correct.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That's not 
  quite accurate.
Harrison_Tang: Oh sorry do you mind the yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So uh I I would say that's roughly correct but 
  uncertain uh time is going to give more details go ahead.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Uh yeah so 
  having been involved in this space for quite a while I was part 
  of the ldp working group.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Solid based 
  itself or solid servers were initially based on.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Solid itself 
  is more of a philosophy.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And and 
  implementation or specification.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That 
  philosophy is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): 2 things 
  first is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): We 
  decentralizing the web.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And what that 
  means is instead of there being like 3 places where you can go to 
  have your blog hosted.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There are 3 
  million places that you can go to have your blog posted.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And it still 
  can be visible.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): As visible as 
  if it were just in those 3.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The way that 
  gets accomplished is by Federation among other things that 
  aggregation.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): People who 
  have dealt with um.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): News readers 
  in the modern sense.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Where they're 
  picking up RSS and atom feeds and aggregating all those feeds 
  into 1 long feed that you read.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Sort of 
  similar to how the old use Net News groups used to work.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The other 
  piece is if I can get my brain to cooperate.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Uh read the 
  centralization and and making the web writable.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's always 
  been globally readable right there's no purpose to having a web 
  server except to let people read it.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Also there 
  needs to be a way for people to write it.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And that 
  writing.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Takes many 
  forms 1 of the most commonly understood ways is wikis like 
  Wikipedia where somebody creates a page on a topic and other 
  people come in and say now wait a minute that's not right or 
  that's not accurate or here's a missing detail and then somebody 
  else comes in and says well this language screwed up so let me 
  fix some of that and somebody else comes in and says well this is 
  only part of a bigger picture so let me make some links back and 
  forth.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The whole 
  web.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Was designed 
  to work that way.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It hasn't 
  been implemented that way because it gets hard quick.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): In themselves 
  are hard to manage.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Uh graffiti 
  you get um.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): A lot of 
  sources that needs to be kept out or removed as you go.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): A Wikipedia 
  used to be a lot more of a free-for-all for anybody who's been on 
  the web for a while.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There could 
  be editing Wars going back and forth on a page for months before 
  somebody came in and said okay this is clearly a point of 
  contention so there's going to be different articles that are 
  branched from this to handle that contention.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Maybe 
  somebody comes in and says this is clearly false data and this is 
  clearly true data and so we're also going to Branch for that 
  reason and and to claim 1 as false and the other a claim as true.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): But this is a 
  big process and its evolving.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Quality 
  implementations that exists solid server implementations excuse 
  me um there is no such thing as solid per se it's not a monolith 
  it's a lot of things as I said it starts out as philosophy.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Solid server 
  implementations that exist.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Are 
  themselves sort of centralizing.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Because it is 
  hard to aggregate data from a bajillion servers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's 
  difficult to present you with a view of a conversation if.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Software that 
  is presenting that view has to pull all of the comments from all 
  of the people's individual servers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Instead of 
  pulling them all from 1.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Right 
  Facebook has they have a bunch of machines but they're all 
  working together to look like 1 server.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And it's all 
  1 big database.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The vision of 
  solid is to have.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): 1 person's 
  data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): A space that 
  in multiple spaces that they control that they say that 
  application can read and or write this data that user can read 
  and or write this data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): All 
  controlled by the individual who owns that data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): This also 
  gets complicated really quickly.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): As that new 
  slide shows there's different kinds of data involved.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There's the 
  data that is between you and your bank or Banks multiple Banks.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There's the 
  data that's involved in magazines or books or movies or music.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That you are 
  mostly consuming mostly reading.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): But 
  occasionally you're going to have something to say about it.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There's also 
  government data and.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The 
  government is or governments are the most consistent about 
  wanting to keep your private data private and keeping the 
  Public's data public.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And also 
  wanting to keep their hands on all of it there's a thing called 
  The Library of Congress which holds 1 instance of.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Most 
  published works in the United States.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It grows 
  infinitely.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): These Works 
  have not necessarily been digitized because the Library of 
  Congress began a couple hundred years ago.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): When there 
  was no internet there was no telephone there was no recording 
  system it was all just paper.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That's going 
  to evolve over time so this is a huge big pile of question.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There was a 
  question a little bit ago about the relationship between solid 
  and linked web servers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): As I said 
  before the solid philosophy.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Needs to be 
  held by.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Um a number 
  of different implementations.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Solid servers 
  as they exist today.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Implement 
  part of the solid vision.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Which might 
  be considered a linked web server.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Those solid 
  servers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): As they're 
  branded right now.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Might be 
  compatible with the linked web server specification as it gets 
  developed.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): They also 
  might not.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): So that's 
  part of why uh the working group is linked web servers which is 
  talking about a style of server.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And not the 
  solid working group which is a philosophical thing with a lot of 
  different tendrils.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I've said a 
  lot of words and hopefully they've made sense I'll let somebody 
  else go.
Harrison_Tang: Well thank you thanks Ted.
Harrison_Tang: Adrian Aaron anything to add.
Hadrian: Um yes I do thank you so much uh Ted.
Hadrian: Insights what I want to say is that the pecan there was 
  a party and I think the guys in the board were asked to present 
  slides that they never saw before it was kind of for fun and it 
  feels like that's what they just did right now because I don't 
  think he saw these slides before.
Hadrian: Um anyway um.
Hadrian: Are there any more questions very soon I I would really 
  like to.
Harrison_Tang: Yes uh I have a.
Hadrian: Uh for the audience to get as much as they can from this 
  from this meeting.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I have a kind of a question a little bit 
  technical questions uh actually uh earlier Ted you're talking 
  about the histories and the contacts now um a question is.
Harrison_Tang: Isn't there a fundamental trade-off between 
  latency performance uh versus uh decentralization and 
  centralization right so to be specific um if you want to focus on 
  decentralization and use Federation uh application use Federation 
  to to to process this data then you'll take a long time right 
  because you need to do aggregations and then do maybe do joins in 
  real time it takes a while but then if you actually aggregate all 
  of them together you'll uh to speed up the performance of such 
  calculations then you're centralizing the data into 1 entity on 
  aggregation layer right so how do you actually uh address this 
  trade fundamental trade-off.
Hadrian: Uh can I take this 1 uh here.
Harrison_Tang: Yes uh huh.
Hadrian: I'm sure that his other stuff to say so.
Hadrian:  to me that.
Hadrian: A massive red herring because I worked in projects at 
  massive scale in the past and it's impossible.
Hadrian: To design this to Define what performance is to whom 
  when and all that even today what we think happens on the web is 
  completely different from what really happens you have cdns you 
  have all sorts of stuff uh if you look at the searches we have 
  algorithms like map reduce there are algorithms created all the 
  time so I don't think.
Hadrian: The way we think perform about performance should be a 
  factor in the way Protocols are built and I stopped here uh Ted 
  I'm curious what uh what your opinion.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Thanks um yes 
  there are trade-offs at all levels of this picture.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Some cases it 
  may make sense to optimize for presentation.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And in that 
  case it may make sense for.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com):  all the.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Data of some 
  conversation or conversations.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Held in a 
  central location.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Sometimes 
  that data will be mirrors of what people hold in their individual 
  locations.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Part of what 
  these individuals control over their data at the same time as 
  applications presented.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com):  we can sort.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Sort of see 
  this in action today in the way that um I think both IOS and 
  Android do this.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): You to Echo 
  your pictures from your smartphone to some storage place on the 
  web which you can also access through a web browser on a on a 
  desktop or laptop machine.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Those 
  pictures do not exist only on your phone and then get presented 
  through that Central thing.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Nor do they 
  only exist in that Central thing and get presented by your phone.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): In both 
  places because that is the way to optimize the use of that data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The services 
  that store the pictures.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Are keeping 
  them as private as you set them.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Know 
  sometimes or well yeah some of them let you do settings so that 
  you can say like Joe can see these pictures but Mary cannot.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Others and 
  this will increase going forward let you use a semantic 
  description to say that.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): My first 
  cousins can see these pictures but my grandparents cannot for 
  whatever reason.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That kind of 
  smart logic in.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Setting 
  permissions it's called attribute-based assets control.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com):  it is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): More 
  attractive thing to use because the systems are getting better at 
  being able to process it as sort of what you were saying about 
  algorithms that get better.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): You'll get 
  better over time but they're not there yet and so some of some 
  recent centralization of the red decentralization.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com):  is going.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): To happen in 
  order to make the presentation fast enough for the consumer.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's not to 
  say there's some performance benchmark.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's to say 
  that I don't want to wait more than 10 seconds for the first page 
  of pictures to show up in my picture browser.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Whether 
  that's a web browser as it is today or it's in iPhoto which is 
  the web the picture browser on Ajo on Mac OS rather uh or it's 
  the pictures on.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): IOS there's 
  there's a whole bunch of applications that present picture data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And this is 
  another part of the solid division is to be able to say I want to 
  use ios's photos.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I want to use 
  Mac OS.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): On the same 
  data files.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Down the road 
  I may want to use a different application I don't know what the 
  name of it is on Android but the data files are likely to be the 
  same whether they're jpegs or gifts or pings or something else.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Those are 
  standardized data formats which multiple applications know how to 
  read and write and interoperate over.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Pictures are 
  a nice easy example of this.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It gets more 
  complex when you start talking about financial data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Is there a 
  different schemas different ontologies different vocabularies 
  that are used to describe that financial data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Having 
  multiple applications able to read and write that data or read or 
  write that data requires.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Some 
  decisions about what vocabulary or ontology to use or at least 
  what are the connections between the multiple vocabularies that 
  exist.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): What I'll 
  same as relations are there.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I throw that 
  in because it's an important thing that people as we get further 
  into the weeds need to understand.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): All same as.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Is a 
  relationship that says that the subject and object of the 
  statement including Al same as the subject and object.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): What does 
  that mean.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The 
  identifier in the subject position and the identifier in the 
  object position.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Same entity 
  it's like my name is tal Ted my name is also Ted Tibido.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Those 2 uh 
  identifiers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Is Al same as 
  relationship except of course that those are just strings they're 
  not Uris and that's deeper into the weeds that we need to get at 
  this moment.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The challenge 
  at hand.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Build enough 
  standardized vocabularies.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Enough 
  application implementers.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Are you able 
  to use.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): That enough 
  applications will be produced that enough users will choose to 
  use or want to use over the data that they have or will have.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And whether 
  they have it on their local pod or is already exists in some.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Silo on the 
  web or it exists on a local floppy disc right all these things 
  are valid.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The challenge 
  is to have the vocabulary is be understood by enough applications 
  that they can open enough files that are becomes a a u.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Critical mass 
  of users.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Users 
  applications and data that they can interoperate that everything 
  is Loosely coupled.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): What is Lucy 
  coupled means.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Loosely 
  coupled means that the banking application.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Can read any 
  banking data not just the data produced by the bank that produced 
  that application.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It means that 
  I can decide that I'm changing Banks and all of my old data can 
  move with me.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): At least my 
  new bank can read all of my old data.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And 
  understand it.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Translations 
  are an element of loose coupling.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): The best 
  loose coupling is.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): You can 
  change things on the fly as you care and that's like using a 
  different web browser.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): There were 6 
  of them give or take.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Major web 
  browsers that you can use to read any website on the web.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Some are a 
  little more bleeding edge than others and so browsers move faster 
  or as sites move faster but pretty much Loosely they work 
  together.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And you can 
  change from chrome to Safari to Firefox on whim.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It's not 
  going to change anything you take the link of a page you're 
  looking at and copy it from 1 Brouse to another and it's still 
  going to work it's going to look roughly the same.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): It might go a 
  little faster a little slower it might show some data a little 
  more pretty than the other that to your eyes but somebody else 
  likes the other and that's all fine because these are Loosely 
  coupled.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): They only 
  connect when they need to.
Harrison_Tang: By the way Ted.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): And again 
  I've had a lot of words.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I'm sorry yeah I just want to do a time check 
  do you have 1 last comment uh.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): No I'm good.
Harrison_Tang: Okay good good thank you thanks Ted so Adrian I 
  know you have other slides that you want to share so do you want 
  to proceed yeah.
Hadrian: No actually that's the last 1.
Harrison_Tang: Got it got it okay cool cool um so earlier tag 
  was.
Hadrian: But we can take more questions uh Harrison.
Harrison_Tang: Got it okay so I I think uh earlier uh you know 
  Ted actually mentioned a good point where uh to to make sure that 
  this string comes true you need to have this uh ecosystem and uh 
  where a lot a lot of pods are going uh basically a lot of 
  adoptions right where it creates a positive reinforcement Loop so 
  my question is like uh what are the market adoptions right now 
  and what are the challenges and what can we do to actually drive 
  more adoption.
Hadrian: Oh man that's a that's a actually Ted said it very well 
  I like what he said although it's a bit theoretical so.
Hadrian: This is a very low conversation in reality I don't know 
  but.
Hadrian: I was thinking what what was the motivation of people 
  paying for isps let's say back in the in the 90s because they 
  didn't provide anything except access right you had to have that 
  connectivity to the internet to then access websites and data and 
  all that.
Hadrian: And that's in a way the case for solid you need to have 
  enough um.
Hadrian: Either solid hosting providers or easy to set up like 
  the Apache browser uh sorry the Apache web server was um 
  technology to install on your Lan to host the solid pods and then 
  you have to have that critical mass of applications that use this 
  data from multiple Parts because you will share data with your 
  family or communities and they will use data from your parts but 
  this applications will provide value for the people who use them.
Hadrian: And that involves writing as well like both Dimitri and 
  and that said and once you have that critical mass and the data 
  resides in the solid parts as I said this would create a sort of 
  universal distributed decentralized uh back end so people will 
  basically only write applications or algorithms to benefit from 
  this data of course.
Hadrian: Agents are a hot topic.
Hadrian: Um AI is a very hot topic uh especially given the um.
Hadrian: Privacy requirements um wallets are also hot and I saw 
  Alex is on the call she's at MIT and they um so interrupt donated 
  1 of the wallet projects that are based on solid parts at the uh 
  uh open Wallet foundation and Alex leads a group at MIT that did 
  the same.
Hadrian: Um so wallets I think are going to be very hot and in 
  terms of governance and acceptance.
Hadrian: I'm not sure who mentioned Gan earlier today but we 
  became members of Gan as well and that's another thing to look at 
  in terms of governance and um.
Hadrian: Promoting more the idea of yeah the work of global 
  acceptance networks and now they are Ira because it was 
  incorporated in Switzerland under this name recently um.
Hadrian: So I'm not sure if I gave you an answer Harrison but I 
  think this would be the Milestones or the the points to look for.
Harrison_Tang: Garden well earlier Aaron shared that in Rob has a 
  very satisfied customer with flandes and Netherland government so 
  what's the user value proposition uh that they chose uh to use a 
  solid interrupt uh versus other types of solutions.
Hadrian: Well I don't think there are other types of solutions 
  with this characteristics but Aaron do you want to talk more 
  about that.
Aaron Coburn:  I think 1 of the value propositions has to do with 
  really this this question of data sharing so building.
Aaron Coburn:  A an ecosystem.
Aaron Coburn:  Where more Innovation can happen so um.
Aaron Coburn:  The government of Flanders is trying to do is is 
  create a structure where the data becomes available for.
Aaron Coburn:  Is you know.
Aaron Coburn:  Oh sort of allowed entities to write applications 
  that can interact with the data.
Aaron Coburn:  The data that's that's really controlled by users 
  in this case um and and then provide additional benefit beyond 
  what the um you know any individual.
Aaron Coburn:  Governmental agency would be able to to provide so 
  that's what they're that's the the basic value proposition that 
  that they're going with and.
Aaron Coburn:   You know.
Aaron Coburn:  Part of it has to do with.
Aaron Coburn:  Rather than having a lot of siloed kinds of of.
Aaron Coburn:  They would have a um.
Aaron Coburn:  Structure of data where the data itself becomes um 
  more of a um more of an object for sharing you know across these 
  permiss specifically permission to sharing across these different 
  agencies.
Hadrian: Uh Aaron may I point out something it may not be obvious 
  um the fact that you have control over who the data is shared 
  with the government data in the pot doesn't necessarily mean that 
  you can alter or even see that data so imagine it's a criminal 
  record it's not like oh it's in my pot I'm going to erase my uh 
  criminal record now.
Hadrian: So I'm not sure if that's obvious but.
Hadrian: Texas doesn't necessarily mean that you're the owner of 
  the data can can modify it.
Aaron Coburn:  Indeed it's not it's not as though I can just uh 
  tell my banking pod that I I have a lot more money than I 
  currently have but there's there's there's um there are a lot of 
  ways to achieve that in terms of as an example verifiable 
  credentials or other kinds of um.
Aaron Coburn:  Uh cryptographic mechanisms to show that you know 
  has a particular bit of data been tampered with or you know who

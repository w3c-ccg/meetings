Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Give me a second.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I can just do 1 I haven't done 1 in in years 
  um I my name's Moni I'm 1 of the uh lead editors and architects 
  of a number of global standards around digital credentials uh 
  notably privacy preserving credentials um uh I've also worked 
  with um I think some of your colleagues uh at uh and uh openai 
  and a number of other um kind of AI companies on this new proof 
  of personhood.
Manu Sporny:  Paper yeah the the personhood credentials paper um 
  and we're trying to figure out a way of uh translating the needs 
  in that paper to uh Global standards here um so we kind of 
  incubate those things in this group and then we take it through 
  the global standards track at the internet engineering task force 
  or the worldwide Web Consortium so I'm 1 of many people in this 
  community that tries to make the web uh a better more privacy 
  preserving uh thing for uh humanity and so really appreciate the 
  work that uh you're doing um in that same vein that's it.
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c/tpac2024-breakouts/issues/37
Manu Sporny:  Sorry just just a few um so uh the w3c uh in-person 
  technical plenary is coming up um at the end of this month uh so 
  that's going to be several hundred of us uh in Anaheim California 
  um 1 of the breakout sessions is on and I'll put a link to this 
  in the chat Channel um on uh the future future standards and 
  Innovations for w3c verifiable credentials um we are going to be 
  covering a lot of stuff that's an incubation in this uh group uh 
  so render method confidence method unlabel ecdsa cryptography 
  Suites uh verifiable credential barcodes verifiable credential 
  API uh transmitting verifiable credentials over Wireless near 
  field communication peer-to-peer and then a variety of vocabulary 
  work so that link takes you to the breakout session um I believe 
  the I I don't know if this is true I think the breakout sessions 
  are.
Manu Sporny:   Open to.
Manu Sporny:  And you can attend remotely um but I'm not not 
  positive about that um so just a heads up there uh the other note 
  is that uh we are continuing to finalize the global standards 
  track stuff for verifiable credentials data Integrity uh in the 
  verified credential working group uh we are continuing to pick up 
  uh implementers I think we have.
Manu Sporny:  11 To 15 now which is great um uh in just a a call 
  out if you are working on an implementation for any of the global 
  standards uh please let us know so we can count you in the number 
  of implementations uh that's it from me.
<manu_sporny> No, please give an intro
<patrick_st.> an introduction would be really useful for me
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> Hmm. 
  Transcriber doesn't appear to be hearing Andrew. Does that mean 
  the recording will also lack his voice?
<manu_sporny> recording will have his voice.
<harrison_tang> yeah, transcriber doesn't work for non-US inputs, 
  but the recording (video and audio) will work.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Patrick St-Louis:  Was that just me no okay.
Manu Sporny:  No a bunch of us got kicked off.
Patrick St-Louis:  I was getting pretty juicy.
<bengo> ðŸ˜…
<manu_sporny> /me calls his lawyer. :P
Harrison_Tang: Yes uh well Andrew uh thank you for a great great 
  presentation I really enjoy it um now in the last uh example you 
  gave is it a home more morphic encryption where you you just like 
  encrypt data and do calculations on it and uh if it's not how is 
  homomorphic encryption calculations different from multi-party 
  computation.
<bengo> ðŸš€ https://docs.rs/risc0-zkvm/latest/risc0_zkvm/
Harrison_Tang: Got it sorry a quick follow-up question uh like 
  earlier so you mentioned about performance trade-offs like what 
  is the uh practical applications uh because like we we actually 
  try it like 4 years ago on the homomorphic uh encryption it was 
  like really really slow so basically practically speaking is not 
  very usable so like how how is how has that advanced like uh in 
  the recent times in terms of performance.
Manu Sporny:  Uh thanks uh Andrew that that was fantastic a great 
  presentation thank you um uh 1 of the things I'm wondering is 
  about you know what what can we be working on that's going to 
  help um you know your initiatives I think what's what's missing 
  right now is kind of the glue that binds our community together 
  with the um kind of the the the AI community so you know we've 
  got tools and we are actively working on zero knowledge proof uh 
  mechanisms Advanced ones Beyond just like you know BBS and things 
  like that so cryptographic circuits and um zkm and snarks and 
  snarks and you know all all that kind of stuff um but we largely 
  think in kind of you know single credentials like a driver's 
  license or a passport or a or a health checkup right I mean you 
  you can have you know education certificates that kind of thing 
  that are held in people's you know private data stores or digital 
  wallets um and and so and there and everything's digitally signed 
  by issuer so this is you know.
Manu Sporny:   As as you.
Manu Sporny:  You have said hi.
Manu Sporny:  Trusted data that is sitting with an individual um 
  and and we have ways of doing a zero knowledge proof on that 
  information that we're holding and then presenting it to in 
  general to the public or to a to a specific thing um but but I 
  think the thing that's missing is we we don't understand um what 
  other things we should be working on that would be high value to 
  your community right so so like you know what are the you know we 
  we've got we've got a set of Technologies and we could run down 
  them and say this is what they do and here's how we think it can 
  help you but we don't have someone from your side going yeah but 
  what we really need is X.
<wendy_seltzer_(she/her)> Why HTTPS?
Manu Sporny:  Okay that's very helpful and and how do we keep in 
  touch with you um that's the that's I think the key thing is that 
  this is this needs to be an ongoing conversation so we need to 
  figure out how we keep the conversation going Beyond this um this 
  meeting.
<wendy_seltzer_(she/her)> (would love to follow up, but need to 
  leave now)

Manu Sporny:  Got it thank.
<harrison_tang> thank you, Andrew!

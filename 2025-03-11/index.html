<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Um a formal objection Council to form and figure out if they want to overrule the objection or keep the objection and ask the working group to do more work or whether or not uh the the the standards end up getting published uh as as Global standards so again you know these things have been under development for 3 years you would think that at this point someone would have said something um that that you know would would uh where they&apos;ve stated it would result in a formal objection but um that&apos;s where we are right now so that voting period will be open for probably about a month um it&apos;ll be open from like March 20th to you know April 20th. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  And then if it looks like um everything&apos;s going fine the final Global recommendations the global standards for those 7 specifications uh will go out um and then the verifiable credential working group will continue uh it&apos;s it&apos;s chartered work which means maintaining the version 2 you know data model maintaining all the other you know data Integrity VC hosie cozy bitstring status list specifications um and then working on things like finally getting around to render method and confidence method and some of the other things that are are in scope BBS is also 1 of those big things that&apos;s still in scope that the working group would would work towards um so I think that&apos;s where we are right now. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>

  getting together working on render method um we're hoping to have 
  some examples out on the VC playground in.
Manu Sporny:  Week or 2 um we also got uh government of 
  Singapore's render method uh integrated into the spec um making 
  good progress there.
Harrison_Tang: Sounds good thank you.
Harrison_Tang: I just saw your email in regards to the verify

  got multiple companies showing support on the issue tracker I 
  don't know if you had seen that.
Harrison_Tang: Uh I haven't uh I haven't actually been actively

  up I will have you uh have you actually been monitoring that 
  threat.

  this so well do you mind actually helping uh uh you know 
  transition the Ripples and things like that yeah.
Manu Sporny:  I I can I can work with you to do that well I've 
  done that before no problem.
Manu Sporny:  Okay thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Cool well thank you thanks will thanks Manu I'll 
  try to catch up on the threads uh uh later this weekend.
Harrison_Tang: All right uh any other updates on the work items.
Harrison_Tang: So last call for the introductions reintroductions 
  announcements or work items.
Harrison_Tang: All right so uh let's get to the main agenda so uh 
  California DMV uh is hosting the mobile driver license Community 
  hackathon uh in the next few months and uh so we're very glad to 
  have Lucy and I think Gail might be hopping on later to actually 
  uh talk about it a little bit more so Lucy uh the floor is yours.
Lucy Yang:  Thank you Harrison I know there's probably 
  potentially resource issues so I just want to show my face so 
  like in case we haven't met in person we're on previous calls so 
  you can put a face to a to a voice um I'm I'm gonna I'll be off 
  video just to you know take that with hi everyone Thanks for 
  thanks um ccg you know Harrison for for having me to do this 
  presentation today as Harrison mentioned like my my my partner on 
  this project Gail hes who's also the the the executive director 
  of open ID Foundation you know she works multiple hats but 
  anyways like she will be hope and she has a conflict with 
  hopefully she will be able to make it later on in the call and 
  small scale and I we are an advisors and Consultants with the 
  California DMV particularly and on the DVD technology side of 
  things and so I am as many of you probably know my my my other 
  hat and as um Kalia young like identity women's and business 
  partner so this is also part of a can of Engagement uh for for 
  our consulting firm so anyways I post um so we are.
Lucy Yang:  Speaking to you today just I'm really asked in a 
  consultant who are leading the projects and on the DMV side for 
  the hackathons so let me share my screen so I prepared some 
  simple slides so you know it's easier.
Lucy Yang:  You to follow what is going on okay.
Lucy Yang:  Can everyone see my slides.
Lucy Yang:  Great so first I I just want to start with like what 
  is oh.
Manu Sporny:  Oh wait a second it it went away when you went to 
  full screen unfortunately I don't know what happened.
Lucy Yang:  Oh okay yeah it's it keeps happening uh it's probably 
  not when.
Lucy Yang:  Is it has it come back.
Lucy Yang:  Cool so I I I won't go for screwing up hopefully 
  everyone can see you know see the the the letters and stuff fine 
  so yeah so so I I I'm gonna um provide kind of a high level 
  overview of the um you know what is the objectives of the 
  hackathon you know what are you know what we have already planned 
  out and what kind of like um.
Lucy Yang:  Sources we're we're like you know we source as 
  partners part participants we're looking for so I'm going to keep 
  it relatively high level but and also we're going to have some 
  time just to have an Q&A I know because.
Lucy Yang:  You you were thinking of yourself in a different 
  could be it get involved in a different role so I'm not going to 
  get into like too much details but I I want to kind of engage 
  with you feel free to ask questions I can't see the chat but you 
  know I feel free to interrupt me if I have any questions on a 
  particular slide I'm happy to just be interactive um you know 
  along the way where we can also save everything until the end of 
  the presentation.
Lucy Yang:  The first I want to just um to share with you because 
  the the overarching objective of the hackathons and so when I say 
  hackathons we are um.
Lucy Yang:  It's more than just 1 event but the idea is just 
  really for to further accelerate acceptance and usage of mobile 
  driving lessons so that's in the California Department of a lot 
  of vehicles so we are initiating so we're not just looking at you 
  know a a c cadmv.com.
Lucy Yang:  Provide you some contacts why you know California DMV 
  you know why me as a consultant me and Gail as consultant work we 
  are um.
Lucy Yang:   Who are working.
Lucy Yang:  Project so back um you know you know back going 
  backwards to 2021 the California legislature authorized the DMV 
  and to conduct a pilot to evaluate the use and and mobile 
  driver's license so as a result like if you're looking at in what 
  we have achieved today is in the over 450,000 California 
  residents are probably very close to a 5,000 uh 5,000 500,000 now 
  are able to use their mdls to prove who they are to various 
  public Insight services and applications without relying on a 
  website where technology company to verify their identity and and 
  to to deliver this pilot to DMV has sold the custom DMV on wallet 
  and make.
Lucy Yang:   Them then the.
Lucy Yang:  Or agnostic particularly by agnostic we mean like we 
  California DMV is doing due issuance and ISO in in both ISO mdl 
  format as well as establish to see on BC format um.
Lucy Yang:   So this.
Lucy Yang:  Improves accessibility by affording California's 
  additional choice in in what devices they use and what and where 
  their store they store and manage their online identities so 
  that's kind of the context and why California DNA is kind of 
  initiating and but there's no like no intention of us being like 
  at the center in the front the center of everything so we do want 
  to have a community approach that's reason why like we where it's 
  not like Cad and B Community hackathon is is a ncdmv hackathon is 
  actually we want to make it uh mdl Community hackathon score 
  we're in relying parties we're also like developers from relying 
  party as well as government and civil society and groups um and 
  particular and and and also digital identity Community as a whole 
  and as I mentioned earlier like my my partner in this project 
  Gail who is also like you know wearing her hat and an open ID and 
  an executive director of open ID foundation so they have already 
  committed support to the event and we're looking for more um 
  Community groups and organizations who are um who are going to 
  want to pitch in and support in different ways and and part.
Lucy Yang:   And then.
Lucy Yang:  We want to.
Lucy Yang:  Thank you w cccg for giving us this opportunity to 
  get you know further involved with Community about this um about 
  this this 2 events.
Lucy Yang:  So what kind of events we're talking about so there 
  are 2 events um so when we call public events which you know open 
  to anyone who want to apply um because we do have limited 
  capacity that's reason why we you know we we we're open to 
  everyone but we are going to have limited spots of 10 to 15 teams 
  and for for the public event um and for the government event 
  that's particularly targeting at government agencies who have a 
  use case and who can come in with you know by themselves or who 
  can come in with with our their existing Partners so that when 
  we're looking a little little bit smaller scale like 7228 teams 
  um to both given that you know like the events are targeting 
  different audience or for the public event we're looking at and 
  hosting it in Silicon Valley and currently we're looking at the 
  the venue like a lot of your very familiar with the Computer 
  History Museum haven't confirmed 100% yet but that's where kind 
  of the the area we're looking at um the government in event which 
  will be um hosting at in in Sacramento when when in 1 of the 
  government um buildings So currently we're looking at the the 
  California Department.
Lucy Yang:   Of Technology.
Lucy Yang:  Um and the tentative date we have here and we have 
  got we have got some feedback regarding um the you know the 
  conflict with some of the other events that going on in parallel 
  so we are you know we have we are still kind of having 
  discussions but definitely we're looking at October for for both 
  events.
Lucy Yang:   Um so.
Lucy Yang:  Terms of use cases you know I've listed some examples 
  and I believe many of you are also very familiar with you know 
  the use cases for for mdl you know you can kyc identity proofing 
  authentication is very kind of all these kind of very intuitive 
  ones we a retail age verification the idea is really any um any 
  kind of use case and that is within the scope like of so we are 
  I'm going to talk about the toolings we're we're have we have and 
  also um getting a little bit more details into what kind of what 
  exactly the format we're issuing so it's really because we are 
  issuing in certain formats that probably all is going to limit 
  what kind of use cases we we can do for for this for this 
  particular hackathon but I'm going to get into it in a little bit 
  later um yeah kind of the we're also looking at for the 
  government events we're looking at some of the um more kind of um 
  like Unique Kind like K use cases in the government and scenario 
  in the public sector scenario like you know the Disaster 
  Assistance scenario like humans uh uh assistance scenario and 
  vital record verification you know that's kind of just examples.
Lucy Yang:   And where any other.
Lucy Yang:  Other kind of use cases for postmark government 
  agencies that are very relevant to to to their you know existing 
  like processes and and and flows so the idea is really um to 
  anyone with a for the public event anyone with a scalable digital 
  identity line party like a use case um.
Lucy Yang:  Actually if you're already like leveraging underscore 
  driver's license you're existing um business processes and seeing 
  like the the digital version and like the mobile driver's license 
  can help you um again especially in the near term um to to 
  improve like efficiency you know reduce fraud or you know reduce 
  costs and these are like all and you know kind of use cases we're 
  looking at and of of course we also we always welcome Innovation 
  that I haven't been you know in exist Like New in use cases that 
  mobile drivers has kind of enable we also encourage teams with 
  those kind of um with those innovative ideas to also kind of 
  apply enjoy and the idea for for for the government event as I 
  mentioned is like the we're we're only focused in targeting like 
  government agencies it could be um it could be like a state 
  California state agency where like local you know Municipal 
  agency work could be in a federal and international government 
  and so we are speaking to some International and also federal 
  agencies who are interested in participating and you're probably 
  going to ask whether we.
Lucy Yang:   Are going to do like.
Lucy Yang:  Um so I.
Lucy Yang:  Are focusing in person and participation but if and 
  if needed we are we we have you know taken into consideration for 
  you know venue and stuff like for those who may need to kind of 
  dial in for for the day um but yes we are focusing on in person 
  in person interaction for for both of the events.
Lucy Yang:  Just quickly just in case you know and like for for 
  the teams we're looking at teams of 3 to 5 people and to be you 
  know join in person on the day so that's um the kind of scale 
  team we're looking at.
Lucy Yang:  So in terms of event agenda this is still kind of 
  very kind of early on you know like tentative like event agenda 
  we're looking at um so so we are.
Lucy Yang:  This is like we call it hackathon but for for the so 
  we only have 1 day for the actual in person event we know that 
  that 1 day is like very like the time is very limited so we do um 
  expect participants to get started early on so we're looking at a 
  month or a month of half of prep time and we will make the 
  toolings and documentation anything you know like that will that 
  can be like true that can be chosen and and you leveraged by 
  relying Parties by participants all you know early uh 4 to 6 
  weeks and ahead and available so you can start already starting 
  kind of like you know playing around with tooling and also we are 
  we are going to provide life support mostly through our partners 
  um our existing vendors and also our partners who are going to 
  provide the tooling we also also be there to provide some kind of 
  like technical support and the preparation phase like the 4 to 6 
  weeks and as well as in you know on event on the day um so this 
  is something we're working on um on like with with some of our 
  vendors and and partners.
Lucy Yang:  Are we will be.
Lucy Yang:  The event so you can you know like what you know what 
  you exactly what you can expect on on the day um but the idea is 
  really like we're we are like only expecting some kind of Final 
  Touch to be done on the day and and the and the rest of time will 
  be the really demonstrating it like your like your your use 
  cases.
Lucy Yang:  On on the day.
Lucy Yang:  That's the case for for both events and we'll 
  probably have some kind of adjustment um to like the the um the 
  lines of the event but you know what you're looking at now is 
  what we you know what we have in mind so far.
Lucy Yang:  So in terms of tooling and support available um so we 
  are so at this point we're we're looking at 5 tracks of um of 
  tooling or support we're 5 tracks of like kind of potential use 
  cases where potential tooling that you can leverage as a 
  participant you can leverage for for tooling and the track 1 and 
  track 2 that's are what and are the track we we know like at 
  California DMV we already have tooling available that can we can 
  provide to potential participants or also like having their 
  promise conversations with some potential Partners who can 
  provide tooling and on those 2 tracks as well as well as the the 
  the the rest of the switch tracks but at least what we can 
  confirm as a track 1 and track 2 so if you have use cases that 
  you can leverage like in person presentation of I'm ISO mdl like 
  -5 format so that's something like the tool and we're going to 
  have um for you to leverage and and and us as well as the track 
  too that's the online presentation so so that's when like the 
  verifiable um.
Lucy Yang:   Because California.
Lucy Yang:  Like in both like um both formats so like the the WCC 
  format is the version 1.1 jot format so we will have tooling 
  available for relying parties to also like verifying to to 
  consume um that version and and have that tooling to build into 
  your own own flows and your own products so these 2 tracks we we 
  have confirmed and depending and because we are looking at a wide 
  range of um potential participants some are more kind of 
  experienced and with you know with the with the standards and 
  with the technology some of the less so so depending on the 
  participant we're having we're going to provide some guidance to 
  to participate in you know developers and and also their teams to 
  to kind of get more context about the the maturity level and of 
  different standards and profiles um so we're we're looking you 
  know if if you you know we're welcome feedback you know if you 
  could you know you have any ideas like any other tracks you know 
  you'll be interested or any if you're will you know interested in 
  providing support we're tooling for any of the tracks you know 
  please feel free to kind of.
Lucy Yang:   You know.
Lucy Yang:  We're we're open to an ideas and obvious world and to 
  to more support to the to the event.
Lucy Yang:  And very briefly to become a partner so I've 
  mentioned like California DM me we are like initiating we're only 
  going to be a co-organizer and at this point like open ID 
  Foundation has confirmed to kind of.
Lucy Yang:  We're also speaking to a wide range of coordinators 
  who are also interested in support as well but in terms of like 
  how what what kind of support we're looking for from a Partners 
  um so California DMV like we're putting it into resources like 
  for me and Gail to help with the program management and 
  coordination and also we have some more vendors and partners who 
  are going to be um kind of providing the access you know becoming 
  expert advisors and providing some toolings available um for the 
  next for the first 2 tracks but but in general we're looking kind 
  of like different types of support in terms of Financial and any 
  kind of support to cover like the direct cost like a venue and 2 
  drinks and snacks and we are looking at providing a worth and and 
  as well um and and also potentially other set of costs that that 
  all kind of a direct cost there are also some kind of other types 
  of support like in terms of technical support So if you know your 
  company or like you know it's aligned with you know have tooling 
  that are aligned with a a hackathon objective and scope um so 
  we're all always welcome like support in terms of like providing 
  tooling documentation as well as like the.
Lucy Yang:   The the actual.
Lucy Yang:  Sort of for the participant and the guidance for them 
  prior to the event and during the events um and expertise support 
  we'll be looking for like you know coaches and judges like on the 
  days you know on the day as well um and you know coaches in terms 
  of like for some of the comp relying parties probably new to the 
  standards where you know they're interested in learning more 
  about you know where like the standards are and you're that kind 
  of like expert coaches we're we're definitely looking and you 
  know interested in having some um to support the participants um 
  and then any working Nations like can help with Outreach support 
  we have reached out to kind of some of you who are you know 
  Community work Nation who can actually have um the the the 
  relying party um participant that we you know they can help with 
  Outreach and and the kind of the least kind of a way of um amount 
  of support that we will we would also encourage if you're 
  organization are kind of find this effort very aligned to your 
  strategy you know to your strategic initiatives welcome you to 
  send a staff to come as a as observers you know observing on.
Lucy Yang:   There and also providing.
Lucy Yang:  Okay back afterwards.
Lucy Yang:  So we do have limited spots for observers and but if 
  you're interested if you find this aligned with your with your 
  objective please feel free to reach out um.
Lucy Yang:  In terms of participants um so like participation in 
  the hackathons are you know will be free I mean we are expecting 
  you know.
Lucy Yang:  Participants to kind of cover their own costs to 
  travel to the venue and to.
Lucy Yang:  2 To participate but you know there's no fees you 
  have to pay in order to participate but we as mentioned we do 
  have limited capacity um.
Lucy Yang:  Already interested like we feel free to reach out um 
  and but we will make an official application available um online 
  so anyone can apply for for the public events soon and the teams 
  and it's mentioned earlier like the teams will receive the 
  tooling and relevant documentation at least like 4 to 6 weeks 
  before the event so you can start your use case development and 
  we will have like um technical support and you know before and 
  during the event.
Lucy Yang:  1 Thing I wanted to highlight that because this event 
  is going to be public so anything you don't want to share with 
  the public we encourage you not to share such information you 
  know and you know in our forum.
Lucy Yang:  Okay so I I think that's that's pretty much um kind 
  of like 1 and all like the high level so if any just want to see 
  if any kind of feedback questions.
Manu Sporny:  Sure I I think 1 Thing Lucy that um I can offer is 
  uh you know we will be meeting digital Bazaar uh will be 
  providing uh support through the open Credit platform that um we 
  had announced a couple of weeks ago um on the on the mailing list 
  that uh provides the mechanism that uh would allow your 
  organization to fairly easily accept um the verifiable credential 
  version um of the California driver's license um so if you think 
  that you know there's not a huge amount it's not a huge 
  technological engineering lift uh to accept the mdl and or the 
  verifiable credential version of the mdl and then do all the 
  processing you would need on it to make sure it's valid that's 
  pretty much there as kind of like an open source tool um Lucy 
  correct me if I'm wrong here I think the expectation was more 
  around like business use cases.
Manu Sporny:  Ations of like.
Manu Sporny:  Okay now that you can consume this you know 
  driver's license this digital driver's license um how are you 
  going to use that to improve you know your operations and your 
  use case.
Manu Sporny:  Is that fair to say Lucy.
Lucy Yang:  Yes thank you for I mean you just provided their exam 
  a very good example of what what kind of tooling and how how 
  we're hoping the participants to leverage tooling and just to um 
  also thank you like manual like digital bizarre and also like 
  Spruce ID who have you know vendors as the California VMV have 
  been very and very helpful in terms of helping us put together 
  the scope and for for the hackathon and like Manu mentioned like 
  the um um like the bizarre has make make the um open crowd 
  platform open source we have 1 DMV so that tooling is already um 
  available out there and and we're like in all the screws team is 
  also working on something for the first track and to um.
Lucy Yang:   And for the.
Lucy Yang:  For the import.
Lucy Yang:  Of the um of iso mdl dat format um yes the idea is 
  really we want to make um the the actually the engineering part 
  as simple as possible so that the buying part because we are 
  targeting and relying parties who already have business use 
  cases.
Lucy Yang:  To really want them to focus on how.
Lucy Yang:   The MD.
Lucy Yang:  Y'all could be could be you know useful you know 
  could be useful to improve their existing processes right whether 
  it's like improving improving efficiency you know reduce fraud or 
  you know like reduce costs and that we want the team to focus on 
  that um but obviously there are you know toolings that you know 
  they're still have to kind of play around with and understand how 
  to use it that's why we're we're also we're looking at a wide 
  range of tooling right and gladly we already have some of the 
  tooling for track 1 and track 2 and then and and whoever you know 
  hand build on the existing tooling provide you know other tooling 
  for for the 2 tracks or other other switch tracks we're all like 
  welcome but the idea is really building on the you the business 
  use cases are like the the focus of of the hackathon so thank you 
  man for for really highlighting the the objective.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah Lucy maybe uh 2 questions the first is if is 
  there some sort of an registration selection process like if you 
  have say 20 PE 20 teams applying for this where you kind of 
  Select them down so to fit the venue.
Lucy Yang:  Uh yes so um mention we are so we're still in the 
  process of really kind of putting together the partners and 
  making sure we have resources and confirm like the days and and 
  and venues and we're almost there and so that's why we haven't 
  put out like official application for participants but we will 
  have have that official like application process which will have 
  like an application form and you have to fill out your use case 
  and we will have to review and evaluate because we do have 
  limited spots but if but if you already have like an idea and 
  feel free to reach out we're already kind of speaking to um 
  potential participants who have like an ideas and interesting use 
  cases so we you know hope this this phase like this kind of a pre 
  official application stage shouldn't be you know shouldn't 
  prevent you from reaching out to us and have a conversation we're 
  happy to provide feedback and.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah yeah great great and then the next question is 
  uh is it like I'm more interested in the mdl as a wallet rather 
  than the mdl as a verifiable credential.
Stephan_Baur: Not to say that that is not of use of course right 
  um so so the question is um you know is it would you consider you 
  know use case ideas that would introduce new verifiable 
  credentials to be issued to the wallet and then obviously 
  presented back to an relying party.
Lucy Yang:  Um so I so let me just make sure I understand you 
  because are you are who you're who you're talking about issuing 
  the additional credentials other than the mdl.
Stephan_Baur: Well so so the the idea we're bringing forward is 
  to do a um health insurance card.
Stephan_Baur: Form of a verifiable credential and have for 
  example medical issue that to the California that I have a 
  license and we on the health plan side would then of course have 
  plenty of use cases to verify it.
Lucy Yang:  I see so I let me let me let me put it this way what 
  what is within scope so what we're like for this particular 
  hackathon so we're looking we're only looking at.
Lucy Yang:  California DMV issuing the current the 2 indeed ISO 
  format and uh um verify 1.1 format into an existing cadm wallet 
  and we're looking at relying parties who can consume other 
  formats of credential in the way that you know like you know 
  whether through online presentation in person presentation that 
  so the relying party are kind of confined in a way that you want 
  you know you won't be able to kind of issue your own thing and 
  but but you can Leverage.
Lucy Yang:  Issue into a user a clap when a resident's wallet in 
  whatever way you.
Lucy Yang:  You can't for example yeah you're talking about the 
  health insurance case you could definitely leverage credentials 
  right and um and you know California residents wallet to prove 
  their you know whatever their their age where their you know 
  their date of birth where their their address and and to 
  incorporate that part of like issuing your house insurance card 
  or something like that.
Lucy Yang:   So that's.
Lucy Yang:  Um but but I don't know like what you're thinking 
  about in terms of like you know issuing more credentials into 
  like um into the DMV wallet that's I'm I'm not sure I don't think 
  that's part of the scope yet.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah that's that's yeah that's the answer is no 
  yeah and then.
Stephan_Baur:  and then you.
Stephan_Baur: You mentioned something there on the day itself 
  around an interoperability sort of discussion and I just wondered 
  um we don't see interoperability to include.
Stephan_Baur:  sort of.
Stephan_Baur: Other organization side works like it's only open 
  Credit it's not for example.
Stephan_Baur: Of the entra verified ID for example where the mdl 
  would interact with that or is it.
Lucy Yang:  Uh I I let me call so we're we are so we are making 
  toolings whatever tooling we have available so like to to the 
  community right we are encouraging and for example if Microsoft 
  like okay they want to make their Android related tooling 
  available to you know to you know to the participants we we most 
  welcome that so at this point I don't I don't know how how much 
  tooling we can make available but we are taking the chocolate box 
  approach so if you have tooling we you know you can make you know 
  some of the SDK or some stuff available to us to to participants 
  great but I I do I don't have like you know like I can't give you 
  like enough certainty how how how what we will have but what we 
  can't what we I'm sharing today is what we already have right 
  what we can potentially have like you know before before the 
  hackathon there's still a lot of you know potential because we 
  we've been speaking to a lot of the other you know um potential 
  Partners who are willing to provide tooling and and for the 
  interrupt.
Lucy Yang:   Part is.
Lucy Yang:  So so there.
Lucy Yang:  So we have our planning kind of in small kind of 
  interop portion of the event so this is what we haven't fleshed 
  out exactly yet that's also part of the 1 of having this 
  conversation was like different communities so is the event 
  itself is less so about like you know interrupt it's really can 
  kind of demonstrate like the usage and can the value of the 
  existing kind of like mdls you know California DMV is issuing to 
  like California residents and businesses but we also know like as 
  you mentioned there are different parties of providing very 
  useful tooling right to business if there are any kind of like 
  interrupt value to them demonstrate to show on the event that's 
  like kind of what we are planning to do for like some amount of 
  time what what we what we call interrupt party so that's yeah is 
  it to be department but we do know that there are probably some 
  interrupt value that we can do for for the event hope that makes 
  sense.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah great thank you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thanks Lucy uh this looks exciting my main 
  question is I if you're interested in this uh where uh where do 
  we follow for updates uh for details will you send out an email 
  to the ccg list when the time comes.
Lucy Yang:  Uh so uh you know there's I have like we have an 
  email like that you can reach me and Gail and then we're pretty 
  responsive to any questions feel free to reach out through this 
  email and we I've shared with uh I think Harrison like a brief um 
  but um I'm I'm we're yeah yes but that's something like we can 
  I'm happy to share again through through the list um and so we 
  like the current brief is focusing on like potential Partners but 
  we also have like 1 targeting and potential participants like on 
  on the way you have a student but yes I'm I'm definitely happy to 
  kind of like you know keep showing up on on on the on on the 
  calls and just you know to provide update and also share an 
  upcoming like materials through through the mailing list.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah it's I guess my question is something as 
  simple as right now the data is tentative it would be great to 
  know when the data is final for that we can.
Lucy Yang:  Oh yeah that that that will definitely will 
  definitely going to have like in a big shout out to to all the 
  communities we've been touched to what once the data is confirmed 
  yeah it's just really really tricky you know that the timing you 
  know with you know that there's other kind of like mdl events 
  going on and also with you know yes and yet but yeah I definitely 
  will will come back with a once we have a confirmed date.
Harrison_Tang: Hey Lucy do you mind sharing this back to the 
  mailing list like to the email thread I send out along with the 
  agenda or you you.
Lucy Yang:  I I yeah I I think it's very um I let me let me check 
  because we have the the brief um which is pretty much the same 
  information I'm pretty much like you know remember I share you 
  with a brief that's pretty much the same so I I have an updated 
  version so let me come back to you I'll definitely share 
  something with the group um within the week.
Lucy Yang:  Okay okay great.
Harrison_Tang: Yes feel free to just uh share directly on the on 
  the list or share with me and I can send it on the list either 
  way is fine.
Lucy Yang:  Okay okay great I'll I'll do that once I you know and 
  which which 1 is the best to share but I will thank you.
Harrison_Tang: By the way a clarification question so uh in 
  regards to the scope of this hackathon so this hackathon is 
  targeting uh.
<gail_hodges> HI, just joined
Harrison_Tang: Parties to use the California uh wallet uh that 
  holds the mobile driver license uh and then targeting basically 
  relying parties to demonstrate uh different business use cases 
  that leverages the.
Harrison_Tang:  the mobile.
Harrison_Tang: Driver license held in California wallet is that 
  correct.
Lucy Yang:  Yes yes so we're yeah we're it's focusing on the 
  really the consuming to verifying side of.
Lucy Yang:  Of the yes relying parties so I I noted that Gail 
  Gail is here Gail you heard what Harrison said and you know it 
  felt like you know what we're I'm communicating the the Mets 
  objectives of the uh of the event is is on relying parties.
Harrison_Tang: Cool and then another clarification questions uh I 
  know in hackathons a lot of times there will be ideas that uh 
  that that we haven't anticipated but what are the use cases and 
  ideas that uh that you guys anticipate this hackathon will bring 
  bring forth like I heard about kyc know your customer compliance 
  anti-fraud like I'm just curious like what are the different kind 
  of use cases that you guys are anticipating.
Gail_Hodges: I mean it's it's a it's a little bit hard to to tell 
  who will ultimately commit um we've had you know feedback from 
  Banks yes they're interested in kyc we've had feedback from you 
  know major um video meeting platform providers that they're 
  interested in participating uh we've had feedback from major 
  entertainment providers that they'd like to um participate 
  especially for to help them think about how to serve um the 
  connection between parents and children or temporary custodian of 
  other people's children um and uh and the list the list goes on 
  we definitely have lots of um stakeholders amongst the the 
  different departments in California that are interested as well 
  as the DHS uh which is interested in participating from a FEMA 
  use case like you have a fire how do you have a credential issue 
  to the user how do you take them through the the FEMA um offering 
  of services to people um or the using of digital identity 
  credentials.
Gail_Hodges:  to better.
Gail_Hodges: Emergency relief staff um so only legitimate staff 
  can get into restricted areas there's been you know quite a lot 
  of different kinds of use cases and of course we don't really 
  know what will come up right from folks who will choose to submit 
  the 1 of the key uh limitations though not only are we focusing 
  on relying party use cases we're also um focusing on end relying 
  parties so the entity that ultimately controls the delivery of 
  that experience to the end user so any um enabling vendors or 
  Partners need to kind of like beyo relying party right so there 
  can be a vendor that there needs to be also then your trusted 
  Bank partner you know vendor plus bank or um you know restaurant 
  chain plus rely plus vendor uh for for that to comprise the the 3 
  to 5 person team that comes um to bring that use case to life so 
  we want to make sure it's not just theoretical use cases it's 
  truly use cases that could get lit up and turn.
Gail_Hodges:  turned on and moving.
Gail_Hodges: Into production if.
Gail_Hodges: That organization decided to do so so by 
  participating in this process and having the support for the 6 
  Plus weeks leading up to the the the the the event itself um it's 
  going to allow these these relying parties to create use cases to 
  be supported in that Journey um and then to have something they 
  can demonstrate internally that can be reviewed by their legal 
  and their compliance stakeholders and it can really bring it to 
  life particularly for executives who don't understand what 
  digital identity really means and why it would be of benefit to 
  them so it's like a focusing Point um to really bring uh bring 
  everyone's attention to bear.
Lucy Yang:  And just to add a little bit to what Gail says what 
  we know that um there are use cases where like mobile driving 
  lessons is only a part of it you'll probably have a more complex 
  use case that you know the the data or mobile driver's license 
  can provide is only a part of the solution and we're also welcome 
  that kind of use case um to kind of participate but.
Lucy Yang:   You know we.
Lucy Yang:  Be able to.
Lucy Yang:  Kind of like let you do a kind of a full end to end 
  demonstration of like oh you know of the entire use case but just 
  focusing on how mdl can add value to what kind of more complex 
  use cases is also something like we you know we we we were 
  interested in as well.
Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Any other questions.
Harrison_Tang: By the way this is uh uh.
Harrison_Tang: Question uh kind of personal question but uh uh 
  I'm wondering about the user experience of of uh General user 
  experience uh.
Harrison_Tang: Of this kind of uh hackathon because like I always 
  give an example a lot of websites they use uh.
Harrison_Tang: Basically social login right so they they do 
  social login or oidc and then the.
Harrison_Tang:  and then.
Harrison_Tang: They the the user the end user basically have the 
  account and then now they want to use a uh this California driver 
  license leverage this uh uh California wallet and mobile driver 
  license uh they have to basically do another like uh uh in some 
  ways oid uh for VPS that kind of uh uh experience again right to 
  to basically do the verification so essentially they have to do 
  it twice is is that is that a correct characterization or what's 
  the general kind of a user experience that uh.
Harrison_Tang: Leveraging this technology can look like.
Gail_Hodges: So if you're talking specifically about login um 
  this is making me think of uh the use case the DMV is lit up for 
  you know a kind of single sign on if you will where you can use 
  your Mobile driving license or your MDOC um sorry I think it's 
  the the VC 1.1 version isn't it um manual keep me honest uh that 
  the um.
Gail_Hodges: You can log into the website but you'd have to kind 
  of present it again to log into the website the next time alright 
  so each time you're logging in um using that credential is that 
  the kind of question you're asking.
Harrison_Tang: Uh like for example the bank use case the when 
  they want to do the ID verifications and uh kind of um no fraud 
  mitigations like Banks like they have their own login systems 
  right and then the or a lot of uh uh Services they they use 
  social login such as Google login and uh so they have to do that 
  once and then if they want to add on to the mobile do the ID 
  verification Via Mobile driver license they have to do it again 
  right it they basically have to do the oidc again is that is that 
  correct or there's other easier more seamless experience.
Gail_Hodges: Many are jumping.
Manu Sporny:  Sure thing yeah I want to underscore what Gail said 
  yeah yes um you know they're they're using the verifiable 
  credential version of the the digital driver's license to do the 
  login Harrison um there is a they're kind of 2 banking use cases 
  at least 2 banking use cases um 1 of them is using the California 
  driver's license uh to do kyc like ekyc so you get a stronger 
  signals about an identity document associated with someone um and 
  then once that's done at the bank uh the bank could have an 
  option of just using the mdl uh to do uh log in so you get that 
  like really strong ekyc every time the customer shows up to log 
  into their banking account um so those are both options um and of 
  course these are early days and we're trying to make sure that um 
  uh we focus on the user experience and make it as seamless as 
  possible and really pay attention to privacy and make sure we're 
  doing.
Manu Sporny:   That correct.
Manu Sporny:  So I I would expect that we're going to we're going 
  to see some things you know during this hackathon that are going 
  to um influence improvements um in the way uh California's uh 
  running this program.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah maybe Harrison just want to add there I think 
  it's also easily possible to match and that you know once these 
  identity steps have been verified through the exchanges to the 
  wallet that you then just punt over to the normal account 
  creation page right.
Stephan_Baur: And of course we.
Stephan_Baur: We're thinking it would be a good you know 
  opportunity to then bring users to actually pass keys right so I 
  think I think that's where where we see a big value on this and 
  maybe Gail you came on perhaps later and I asked the question but 
  I the use case we're thinking is we would actually like the 
  presentation do I have a bundle of 2 VCS 1 being the 1 for 
  identity the other 1 being for health coverage right and the 
  Beautiful sort of use case on that is or user experience and that 
  is if you just do you know an online you know appointment and you 
  have to share your you know insurance card anyway right you do 
  this digitally you have an immediate concreation with the 
  provider like with the doctor's office or in a later can come 
  back and pull your data from.
Stephan_Baur: But anyway for that for that we need to to be open 
  to indeed um additional sort of verify potential to and that 
  doesn't seem to be in scope for now so we'll do this later.
Lucy Yang:  I think Stefan if you have a existing wallet um that 
  can hold the house credential you can actually you can build a 
  business flow that consume 2 creds just from different wallets 
  and I know it's not ideal I'm just you know pointing out is still 
  possible as I mentioned like we are taking into consideration the 
  use cases where mdl is only part of the.
Lucy Yang:   You know.
Lucy Yang:  1 Of the credentials that um a user would need and to 
  get verified by relying party.
Stephan_Baur: Hey no worries I'll I'll Lucy and Gail I'll reach 
  out to you guys and you know we have the conversation with the 
  DMV team as well and you know maybe there's just a bit of 
  different misalignment issues there so we'll clarify thank you.
Gail_Hodges: I I think that's fine I mean we're we we welcome 
  those kind of questions to test the boundaries right like the the 
  entertainment provider I was describing there there isn't yet a 
  standardized way of how 1 think about um linking a parent to a 
  child or a parent to a uh the temporary custodial of someone 
  else's child like your niece or nephew or a neighbor's child 
  right there's not really a standardized way to approach that yet 
  but it's a really interesting use case and it might be possible 
  to call the club together some standards and and try and answer 
  it so there might be something similar when it comes to linking 
  identity and health coverage so we don't want to try and uh Chuck 
  anything out the window at the same time our bias is towards um 
  use cases that could be lit up and could be brought into the real 
  world you know in a frame in a time frame of before the end of 
  the year right so um but we we we welcome those conversations.
Lucy Yang:  Harrison I just want to quickly go back to to your 
  earlier question a little bit because M man you mentioned the the 
  2 kind of use cases for for banking snail once it's just getting 
  um when you're getting on boarded to become a client doing an 
  identity proofing right the what what the current practice and a 
  lot of banks were even just like web services are using an 
  existing idb provider which they have to pay per transaction and 
  the value here I can see mdl can do is really provide you another 
  option that you know it's it's already it's government issued 
  digital ID you can use without actually that additional cost so 
  that's 1 1 thing I want to add another thing is that the Second 
  Use case where like you're using for login so what we're really 
  trying to do is making the tooling available so you don't have 
  like the the relying party doesn't have to build everything from 
  from scratch it's like you have like the sdks available where 
  like some even some things even probably simpler that you can 
  leverage kind of a button you click and then get.
Lucy Yang:   You know.
Lucy Yang:  Get get thing you know.
Lucy Yang:  Exiting mdl verify from your wallet right that's kind 
  of like the um what like the tooling we're hoping to put out 
  there are some of the relying parties doesn't have to you know 
  all all doing all the heavy lifting and that's that's also part 
  of reason my man team has made the the open grass um platform 
  available in open source.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah the reason why I asked that question is 
  because uh.
<gail_hodges> Our asks of W3C CCG and the FedID WG/ WiCG: 1) 
  Partnership with the community/ CA effort itself, e.g. funding 
  support, volunteer resource support,  observer opportunity 2) 
  Early notice to consider participating and bringing RP use cases.
Harrison_Tang: Well during the onboarding process not not the 
  recurring login uh but during the onboarding uh first time user 
  experience process like uh at this moment most of the idv I did 
  identity verification is done uh automatically right uh actually 
  the user is probably don't even know that it's happening uh so 
  while this uh um you know basically verify through the wallet uh 
  idea is more uh more transparency with user consent so on so on 
  so on it does add additional frictions uh so I I I just been 
  wondering if there's a this is outside scope of this particular 
  uh hackathon topic but I I have always been wondering about 
  whether we could achieve uh both objectives right in other words 
  uh more um transparency but at the same time like uh the seamless 
  uh experience like you know so that's why I was asking about the 
  user experience.
Lucy Yang:  I understood thank you for the question but at least 
  I think you're right in terms of the you know the user will have 
  different options they have to choose it's like when I mean at 
  least you know in Canada when you know some of the government 
  website they're like multiple options I have to evaluate which 1 
  works best for me I would imagine probably similar scenario um 
  for for you know for the onboarding process it's definitely not 
  the most like user user friendly but uh but yeah that's that's 
  what what we're starting right now.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah yeah yeah definitely I I mean in.
Harrison_Tang: Businesses uh they.
Harrison_Tang: Only look at.
Harrison_Tang: That uh CPA is cost per acquisition uh for the 
  first time user experience uh and that that's actually really 
  really important because uh if your cost per acquisition is high 
  in fact if it's higher than your lifetime value uh the business 
  model doesn't work right so so when 1 of the ways to reduce CPAs 
  is to make sure the onboarding experience is a frictionless as 
  possible so it's not just um.
Harrison_Tang: Nice user experience benefit but it's actually 
  business critical to have a very seamless frictionless onboarding 
  experience and and generally speaking not always but generally 
  speaking the more steps you add right it increases your friction 
  and uh your CPA so.
Harrison_Tang: Anyway so again this is outside the topic of 
  today's session but uh I have always been wondering about 
  different kind of user experiences that balance uh and actually 
  uh achieve uh multiple goals and uh you know just curious if 
  other people have other ideas that's all.
Gail_Hodges: So apologies that I couldn't join until halfway 
  through today's call um but I guess maybe you can catch me up on 
  the temperature of this group's conversation so the ask of of 
  California to the w3c and that's both to this group The ccg and 
  more widely the FED ID um working group uh and the ycg working 
  group is you know whether the w3c community would like to partner 
  in this community effort you know together with California and 
  other players that will come to Bear uh the open ID Foundation my 
  other hat certainly plans to support the work um but many digital 
  platforms and other nonprofit bodies we expect will also choose 
  to partner so that's the first question of the w3c and then the 
  second question you know second point where I think we spent most 
  of the time since I joined is is really this early notice to you 
  all of um the the sub of the of the announcement will make uh for 
  for relying parties to consider participating so consider this 
  in.
Gail_Hodges:  early heads up.
Gail_Hodges: If you're already thinking.
Gail_Hodges: Being such a relying party um but on that first 
  point of of w3c partnership um is that something Harrison uh 
  yourself and and and other leaders of the ccg can kind of take 
  away and come back to us and and um share a whether you'd like to 
  be observers be whether you might have funding to support us see 
  whether you might have people resources um and that could help us 
  the those are the kinds of things we're particularly looking for 
  from Partners um and of course there is branding and promotion 
  and I think the really good Optics of of working as a wider 
  Community to to bring digital identity to life.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah uh definitely uh we can kind of take it 
  offline but in regards to kind of uh.
Harrison_Tang: Branding support uh I mean financially w3c ccg 
  doesn't uh have have a funding uh but that said you know uh 
  branding wise and uh you know uh in terms of participations I 
  think will definitely willing to help because this definitely 
  furthers uh you know our community as a whole but we can take it 
  offline and then the uh also um my side right uh in regards to 
  Spokeo and things like that to to the to the extent where we can 
  help like we're definitely willing to help.
Gail_Hodges: Great thank you.
Gail_Hodges: Appreciate that feedback and of course happy to take 
  it offline and let you all discuss a bunch of yourselves as well.
Harrison_Tang: Uh any other questions last questions.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Sometimes when the 2 main cameras is actually uh 
  the GT has 10 Coe issues but anyway uh I think this concludes a a 
  today's meeting anyway but thanks a lot Lucy thanks Gail for 
  jumping on.
Gail_Hodges: Oh thank you for having us.
Lucy Yang:  Thank you have a good 1 everyone.
Harrison_Tang: All right have a good 1.

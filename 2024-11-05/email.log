Harrison_Tang: Welcome uh welcome everyone uh to this week's wvc 
  ctg call uh last week was the internet identity Workshop 39 and I 
  saw some of you guys so it was really good to actually uh meet 
  the real person behind people's names so uh very very glad about 
  that uh later uh just want to take a quick 3 to 5 minutes uh to 
  see if anyone wants to share their thoughts on IW or great 
  presentations that they saw that maybe we can invite the speakers 
  to actually be a discussion on those topics.
Harrison_Tang: Today our main agenda is actually we're very glad 
  to have Adolf uh and Kenya to talk about the dif decentralized 
  identity foundations credentials schemas work but before that I 
  just want to quickly go through some of the administrative stuff 
  um first of all just want to do a quick reminder on the code of 
  ethics and professional conduct basically just use common sense 
  and make sure that we hold constructive and uh great 
  conversations and we've been doing that but still want to uh do a 
  quick reminder.

  recording um actually within the next day or 2 I think we've been 
  pretty good like obviously in these meetings on time so if you 
  have any questions in regards to Prior meeting notes just let any 
  1 of us know.
Harrison_Tang: A quick note um so most recently sometimes uh uh

  re-engage uh feel free to just unmute uh and actually uh 
  introduce yourself.
Tom S:  Oh hi everyone thank you uh my name is Nas and I'm from 
  India I'm pretty new to this space of SSI or the whole activity 
  that's going on here I'm still learning I come from a monetary 
  reform background uh working in ngos and also a little bit of 
  blockchain experience so that's pretty much about me thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Welcome welcome your lovely here so if you have 
  any questions uh feel free to just reach out to any of our any of 
  us because we're quite open and welcoming anyone else feel free 
  to just unmute.
Harrison_Tang: All right any announcements and reminders.
Manu Sporny:  Uh thanks Harrison um a couple of um I guess not 
  well announcement e things on things that happened last week so 
  this is um after iiw I know we're going to talk about iiw a bit 
  but um after iiw the state of California uh their Department of 
  Motor Vehicles the California DMV.
Manu Sporny:  Held a community hackathon.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-hosts-second-community-hackathon-to-facilitate-additional-public-sector-uses-for-mobile-drivers-license/
Manu Sporny:  Focused on government uh use of verifiable 
  credentials uh there's a press release that they released about 
  it here I'll put that link in the chat Channel um.
Manu Sporny:   It was a real.
Manu Sporny:  Great event uh a lot uh a lot more California 
  government agencies are starting to use um specifically 
  verifiable credentials so you know when they talk about it they 
  say mdl but that's being used largely as a marketing term when 
  you look at the technology itself underpinning a lot of the use 
  cases there is some ISO mdl usage but the vast majority of the 
  usage is w3c verifiable credentials um and just last week uh 
  number of new initiatives new types of digital credentials uh as 
  verifiable credentials were announced uh unfortunately I don't.
Manu Sporny:  Think I can.
Manu Sporny:  Talk about that stuff just yet because they wanted 
  to keep you know it kind of to a government only event um but I 
  think this community should expect many of those uh types new 
  types of verifiable credentials to be announced here over the 
  next couple of weeks um the other kind of takeaways were that.
Manu Sporny:  Um uh 830,000 uh people have now installed the 
  California DMV app uh which includes uh full support for uh w3c 
  verifiable credentials as well as ISO mdl um.
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/stateofca/opencred
Manu Sporny:  Those uh verifiable credentials are being used uh 
  with the open Credit platform which increasingly a number of 
  agencies in California are starting to deploy I'll put the link.
Manu Sporny:  To the open Credit platform there that lets you 
  verify um a verifiable credential version of the California 
  driver's license.
Manu Sporny:  Uh there were a number and this is public the 
  agencies that participated in the hackathon which is actually 
  built stuff out or building stuff out was uh US Air Force um 
  usdhs uh us uh General Services Administration so login.gov 
  things like that um.
Manu Sporny:  The California governor office of emergency 
  services so caloes they do all the firefighters and uh EMTs and 
  paramedics and folks like that um California Highway Patrol uh 
  DMV uh California office of data Innovation the city of Los 
  Angeles and then they had uh folks come in from overseas and 
  other other states within the US like the M Michigan Department 
  of Health and Human Services uh West Virginia Secretary of State 
  um uh we had uh our neighbors to the South um the city of uh Mex 
  Mexico City and Mexico in general with their digital drivers uh 
  licensed credentials um came into the presentation so uh lots of 
  really good traction um.
Manu Sporny:  With the digital credential stuff especially in 
  California and I think we're starting to now see how like.
Manu Sporny:  You know it it really helps to have multiple 
  different agencies all kind of consuming each other's uh 
  credentials uh the driver's license is kind of like 1 of those 
  fundamental uh credentials but now because of that uh being kind 
  of a foundational digital identity document we're seeing other 
  digital identity documents um being published uh through um 
  through California agencies working with each other so lots of 
  really good news for w3c verifiable credentials um last week 
  that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you man uh quick question by the way 
  man uh I know the California supports both uh ISO standards and 
  w3c standards but that said I don't think the users can pick the 
  standards they probably don't even know what's the underlying 
  standards right so when you said that yeah when you said that the 
  usage of w3c is more uh can you explain that a little bit more 
  like how yeah how is w3c has more usage than ISO is the the users 
  cannot even make a choice.
Manu Sporny:  Um because the the there's 180137 is an implemented 
  anywhere and so you can't ask for it so the only usages of the 
  mdl are kind of like you know uh boarding an airplane uh all the 
  other usages are like the true age verifiable credential um it it 
  we know because of the protocols that are currently being used 
  the only protocol that works online right now is the uh oid for 
  um uh uh VC apis also supported with um.
Manu Sporny:  With the open Credit platform but most of these 
  agencies are deploying open credit and the only current 
  deployment of open credit that you know works is for the 
  verifiable credential uh version of it so in convenience stores 
  in online settings it's the verifiable credential version of the 
  the credential that's going across um did that answer your 
  question.
Harrison_Tang: Yes thank you thanks for the clarification.
Harrison_Tang: And Joe you're in the queue.
Joe Andrieu: https://digitalfiduciary.org
Joe Andrieu:  Uh thank you Harrison um just want to share with 
  people that the Monday before I W at vrm day we announced the 
  digital fiduciary initiative which is putting Humanity back in 
  identity by creating a new professional class of individuals who 
  are committed to putting the interests of identity subjects first 
  um you can learn more about the initiative at uh the 
  https://digitalfiduciary.org.
Harrison_Tang: Thank you thanks Joe.
Harrison_Tang: Any other announcements and reminders.
Harrison_Tang: Right just want to take a quick 5 minutes uh to 
  see if anyone want to share their thoughts uh or summary in 
  regards to the internet identity Workshop.
Harrison_Tang: Any presentations that they thought is uh quite 
  interesting that they want to share with the community here 
  although please.
Geun-Hyung Kim: :Clap:
Nate Otto:  I mean yeah but by far I take the the most exciting 1 
  for me was to see the the update by Google on uh the credentials 
  digital credentials API which now includes uh credential issuance 
  as well as the presentation flow um I thought that was quite 
  informative uh seeing how they've you know further the work there 
  and then secondly the the the need for privacy I thought was very 
  interesting uh so much so that Google had you know a couple of 
  phds present uh a creative way on how to do um zero knowledge 
  proof from an ISO MDOC but the conclusion being that you still 
  need to somehow change you know the signature like it it doesn't 
  it doesn't just translate as is on on the current ISO M Dog you 
  do need to to uh a special kind of signature to be able to do on 
  linkability um so I think uh yeah just the need for privacy uh 
  ISO MDOC doesn't solve privacy and we need more Alternatives 
  there so.
Harrison_Tang: Well thanks for sharing and by the way do you know 
  those Google guys like because I didn't have the chance to attend 
  that session and I would love if uh love to learn more about the 
  Google's digital credentials API.
Nate Otto:  Yeah Abby shalat in Mattel frigo I'm happy to share 
  their their contact info.
Harrison_Tang: Got it I I'll follow up with you later all right 
  cool well please.
Harrison_Tang: Yep well actually it will we can always change the 
  time too I will do a special session we've done it before so 
  yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Wanting to press 1 when Auto said about I.
Harrison_Tang: No we can't hear you thanks.
Harrison_Tang: Actually I think we lost you.
Harrison_Tang: We lost the metre.
Harrison_Tang: We'll come back to him.
Harrison_Tang: After he rejoins uh any anyone else want to share 
  their thoughts.
Harrison_Tang: Sorry hold on a second.
Kaliya Young:  Um I shared about my internet engineering task 
  force research that I this summer.
Kaliya Young:  It was funny in closing Circle Drummond was like.
Kaliya Young:  Right like talking about how we've made iaw and 
  it's pretty amazing and.
Kaliya Young:  How the ITF in some ways I mean the ITF is 30 
  years older than IBEW um.
Kaliya Young:  So I shared about what I learned in the research 
  and I'll put a link to the paper that we wrote um.
Kaliya Young:  Just understanding its governance processes as a 
  kind of living organization with no paid staff that.
Kaliya Young:  Um defines the protocols for the internet um so.
Kaliya Young:  I'll just put a link and if folks want to.
Kaliya Young:  Draw inspiration for it for exploring governance 
  options in our community that would be a great outcome for having 
  done the research I think they have fairly interesting Innovative 
  practices that I've seen almost nowhere else.
Kaliya Young:  Um including selecting their core leadership via a 
  process.
Kaliya Young:  Where the decision makers about who gets into 
  leadership are just 10 people.
Kaliya Young:  Randomly selected from the body of the membership.
Kaliya Young:  And membership being defined as people who've been 
  to 3 out of the last 5 meetings as there is actually no formal.
Kaliya Young:  Gatekeeping on who is a member other than joining 
  a mailing list.
Harrison_Tang: Cool thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Demetry at your back.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah uh can you hear me okay.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh yeah so I wanted to plus 1 what Auto said 
  about what really caught my eye was the.
<kaliya_identity_womand> Here is a link Exploring the 
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh the updates for the digital credentials API 
  from the uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Chrome and Os teams uh and also specifically 
  uh presentations on uh potential new.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Credential query language uh dcq um so so that 
  that was interesting to see the the other thing that I noticed is 
  that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There were a bunch of sessions on trust 
  Registries a subject near and dear to my heart and I think of 
  interest to to this community here.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   So I.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Did a trust strategies 101 session but more 
  importantly there were uh I series of sessions of European Union 
  is in the process of adopting a trust strategy framework for 
  issuers and verifiers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  On a fairly short time scale and so there were 
  the design discussions and brainstorming on what that oh 
  architecture is going to be B and and they're leaning towards.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh some combination of x509 and open 80 
  Federation spec uh for that so so a lot of there was a session on 
  trust Registries in higher Academia.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Lots of interest there in on that topic that's 
  it for me.
Harrison_Tang: Thanks for share so uh yeah I'll definitely work 
  on getting the Google digital credentials API guys uh to present 
  here uh sometime uh actually it will be q1 of next year because 
  we're booked till January 28th now so.
Harrison_Tang: Write any 1 last thought and then we'll get to the 
  main agenda.
<kaliya_identity_womand> (they only came to one day of IIW and 
  arrived after agenda creation)
Harrison_Tang: All right a quick thing so next week uh we will 
  have Stephen uh from open Ai and then actually a lot of you guys 
  are in the co-author of the person who credentials paper so we'll 
  talk about that uh by the way uh I still couldn't get the war 
  coin guys to present here so uh this is uh this is as good as it 
  gets right in terms of proof of a person who the proof of 
  humanity kind of work uh in W3 and then the week after that we'll 
  have the Open session on the Q4 2024 review and work items so uh 
  feel free to uh uh just talk about anything right or if you have 
  further thoughts that we didn't get to today you know like in 
  regards to IBEW um just uh.
Harrison_Tang: Just talked about that um November uh 19th it'll 
  be an open session.
Harrison_Tang: All right so in the interest of time just want to 
  get to the main agenda again very excited to have Auto here to 
  actually present his work on the dif credential schemas so that 
  you know it's a I I actually briefly look through that work it's 
  very very cool so uh.
Harrison_Tang: The floor is yours.
Nate Otto:  Yeah okay perfect let me just share my screen.
Nate Otto:  Uh yep let me know if you can see it.
Nate Otto:  All right thank you so yeah uh tomorrow I would 
  provide ID also a member of the dif co-chair at the credential 
  schemas uh work item and join here by Kim Hamilton who is the uh 
  executive director at the if.
Nate Otto:  So uh yeah.
Nate Otto:  Forward and uh talk to you a little bit about um what 
  the work that we've been doing on both the basic person schema as 
  well as some of the work that Kim is starting around the proof of 
  personhood.
Nate Otto:  Um so I guess this is kind of preaching to the choir 
  here why schemas and why they matter right uh in in it comes down 
  to it the summary is we want to ensure consistency and 
  interoperability uh even across different identity protocols and 
  credential schemas uh being standardized help us to establish 
  that trust and facilitate that interoperability and you can see a 
  little table there of our basic person abstract data model um 
  we've created for uh just reference.
Nate Otto:  The use cases that we're targeting uh both um in kyc 
  and KYB uh and so the uh discussion today is around our version 1 
  of the basic person schema which is uh defining a person for kind 
  of kyc type use cases um also proof of humanity and personhood is 
  Kim will be talking about those as well um and then also AML 
  right we do want to have in a separate AML credential that can 
  facilitate identifying whether users have been in any of those 
  sanctions list uh and stating that in a credential uh also 
  another piece of work that we actually did talk about at iaw 
  towards uh the end of the of the conference there 1 session uh an 
  initial effort around H verification and estimation so we want to 
  approve of age credential that can support both verification and 
  estimation.
Nate Otto:  So um the way that we're managing the credential 
  schemas uh is with this idea of what we call an abstract data 
  model which is this table format with field names and 
  descriptions and then from there on your uh free to be able to 
  implement that in your favorite uh credential format uh that you 
  like whether it's Json LD such as we do in Privado ID VC chats or 
  Json of these and checked or is the jots as you would in an open 
  ID for VC so this allows flexibility and um kind of consistency 
  without imposing any uh.
Nate Otto:  Restrictions and so on.
Nate Otto:  So uh to jump into the basic person schema uh the 
  purpose of this schema is is as I said to define the the set of 
  fields that we would need for defining an individual for kyc 
  purposes uh and then enable that interoperability uh you know 
  across various use cases in financial services and others uh the 
  schema spec itself aligns to the open ID connect uh open ID for 
  ID assurance and ebsi for natural person um schemas and we've 
  done harmonization and mapping of the fields in order to 
  facilitate interoperability with those standards uh the schema 
  you know kind of excludes the the the work of assurance levels 
  and verification process uh because we want to Center mainly on 
  the data fields and less so on the process that it took to get 
  that there right but that is not to say that you would be able to 
  perhaps develop a wrapper around this credential schema to 
  include that Assurance level uh and verification process details.
Nate Otto:   If you so.
Nate Otto:  And then use cases uh mainly financial services but 
  you could also use it for telecoms or any other uh use case that 
  requires ID verification for customer onboarding and so on.
Nate Otto:  The structure of the schema is a main table with the 
  basic person uh details uh followed by a set of uh array objects 
  1 for the names of the person and we do require 1 uh name at 
  least at a minimum the legal name 1 set of addresses uh with a 
  minimum address being the place of birth of the person um a set 
  of identifiers which could be able to government and 
  non-government identifiers and the requirement being that there 
  be at least 1 form of government identifier.
Nate Otto:  The list of contact channels uh which is just another 
  array of contact Channel objects and then finally uh support for 
  various nationalities uh that the person uh might have as well so 
  um I'll be just summarizing some of the the different objects in 
  in sub objects here but you can feel free to look at this 
  credential schemas uh specification here uh that we have and we 
  are now published this in a working group draft where uh you can 
  just come in and and check it out and you know get a feel for it 
  and so on but we won't be going into a lot of detail of the spec 
  itself just summarizing it.
Nate Otto:  So um to continue the presentation.
Nate Otto:  The uh main components are that basic person data 
  model which defines your birth date sex gender and nationalities 
  of the credential subject it includes a provision for an array of 
  custom fields for any additional ones that may be required and 
  some specific instances the name object will be able to record 
  the names of the person it will require at least 1 entry 
  corresponding to the users's legal name.
Nate Otto:  Secondly we have the identifiers object uh which 
  would record those government identifiers or non-government 
  identifiers and again would you require at least 1 entry 
  corresponding to their uh government identifier because this is a 
  kyc focus type use case.
Nate Otto:  And then secondly we have the address object with the 
  addresses of the subject uh it just require at least 1 entry for 
  the subjects place of birth and uh finally the contact Channel 
  objects which records various contact methods could be email 
  phone or others uh we do assume that the credential issuer will 
  have verified that the subject is in possession of those contact 
  channels uh if it's an email you probably sent a link to them or 
  if it's a a phone maybe you send an SMS text message or a phone 
  call to validate that the person is in possession of that contact 
  method uh so the details of how that's done is outside of the 
  spec but we do have that that assumption that we documented.
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> uh-oh... 
  "requires at least one (legal) name". See 
  https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood especially 
  https://shinesolutions.com/2018/01/08/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names-with-examples/ 
  specifically "40. People have names."
Nate Otto:  And that is that is basically it as far as the 
  structure of the of the spec itself in in summary but we do 
  invite you to come participate and and um you know give us your 
  feedback this is now in in working group draft and the idea being 
  that um this will support you know at least uh a variety of use 
  cases in the provider ecosystem we do have an implementation of 
  it and it is actually listed here um you can see it here in our 
  schema Explorer tool where we've actually implemented that and 
  are actually using that with a variety of customers but the idea 
  being we want adoption uh and we want to have your feedback and 
  so on so that's very important also the folks at uh open ID did 
  give us feedback on this uh Adrian field so that is also been 
  very useful in enhancing the schema but we you know we do invite 
  more participation and feedback.
Nate Otto:  So uh yeah any comments or uh anybody want to jump in 
  here Kim do you want to provide any additional commentary.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So can you hear me.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Okay excellent I have had issues with jitsi in 
  the past so um thank you Otto the Inn in I want to say just 
  incredibly great work on this Auto and the.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Work item in if you've done a lot of work 
  reconciling this with different schemas and I think um 1 thing I 
  like about this approach is calling out the abstract.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Data model and then mapping it to different 
  formats and encodings and um you know hoping that that will help 
  us.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   Kind of.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Future proof some of this work a little bit 
  more.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um any questions about this before we move on.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah I just want not so much a question as like a 
  plus 1 this this looks great like you know I think this is 1 
  these are these are the things that are kind of um slowing down 
  adoption I've heard that said you know not just in this community 
  but you know in the digital credentials you know group at at at 
  w3c the browser you know things saying that hey we really need to 
  start focusing on the schema so that people can have these things 
  that they can just you know pick up off the shelf and start 
  issuing you know useful credentials um that have you know 
  business value um so plus 1 to that really wonderful to see uh 
  this work being done um there you know I'm kind of looking 
  looking through this I guess there's a.
Manu Sporny:  Years I think.
<harrison_tang> by the way, here is the link to the credential 
  schemas:  
  https://identity.foundation/credential-schemas/#abstract
Nate Otto: :+1:
Manu Sporny:  I think the open question is like where does this 
  work happen it is definitely happening at a diff and I think 
  that's fantastic um and I think we should also you know ensure 
  that the work doesn't centralized in any particular place like I 
  think the whole purpose behind all these technologies that we're 
  building is so that you don't have to go through like you know a 
  quote unquote you know official Global standards development 
  organization to create these vocabularies um but 1 of the 1 of 
  the questions that has come up is like the people that are 
  creating these kinds of things are like well where do we get 
  official review where do we asked uh you know for input so have 
  have y'all put kind of you know um thought into that like you 
  know how do people know that this thing is safe to use is it 
  after it gets through the diff process or is there a notion of 
  like horizontal review with the verifiable credentials working 
  group what what are your thoughts.
Manu Sporny:   On like.
Manu Sporny:  How does this thing become stable to the point 
  where people can go I'm just going to use it I can see that it's 
  stable I'm just going to use it.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah I can start with it auto and then um I'll 
  turn over to you so the point that it's in right now is it's 
  getting uh working group review slash um you know Auto Spin 
  reaching out to a lot of other orgs uh ietf um and actually 1 of 
  our co-chairs is in ietf and Oasis the lightweight verifiable 
  potential group that's working on something similar and then all 
  of the other schemas that you see referred to so we are getting 
  in informal horizontal review I like the idea of a um you know 
  it's it's not a standard part of the diff process I think usually 
  what we do is after working group review it goes through uh 
  steering committee approval and then we publish it with this 1 we 
  do want to make sure it's broadly socialized.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So we're open to any suggestions on that um you 
  know for diff it's a success if schemas get you know we we love 
  incubating them and promoting them and standards can live at diff 
  it's also success if it ends up living somewhere else so there's 
  2 aspects of that we are um working on within this group we're 
  allowing people to contribute schemas that then the workings 
  group.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um how do you say refines develops so that it 
  can become a um you know.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Improve specification and we're working on 
  discovery of those schemas because basically it's it's the usual 
  problem like how do I avoid having to reinvent the wheel when I 
  am issuing my credential right so we want to help promote that 
  discoverability but then we are not we don't those schemas 
  themselves do not have to live in diff we're happy referencing in 
  different locations so I think there's 2 concerned past problems 
  of the fork I guess 1 is discovery of it reference ability the 
  other is where does the schema live and so you know we're making 
  a lot of progress within diff right now I think we're also open 
  to you know if this makes sense that ietf or Oasis or wherever um 
  open to those conversations as well.
Harrison_Tang: Money do you have a follow-up comment.
Manu Sporny:  Uh yeah yes so plus 1 the everything Kim said um 
  you know I think yeah Discovery is super important uh we need to 
  you know as as a community multiple communities focus on that and 
  making that happen I guess I'll I'll mention offhand that you 
  know we're already looking at the next verifiable credential 
  working group Charter and we're thinking that the VCW could have 
  like experimentally do like horizontal review on vocabularies 
  because you've got a lot of people there that kind of understand 
  you know vocabulary stuff not as like a mandatory it has to be 
  done but as kind of a demonstration that hey it it you know 
  multiple communities looked at this to see if it's you know um if 
  it's okay if all its best practices and and things like that um 
  so just putting that out there maybe Kim there's a future 
  discussion to be had around like what does horizontal review look 
  like.
Manu Sporny:  No matter where these vocabularies happen you know 
  and and the same thing would apply for like vocabulary is done at 
  like w3c there would be horizontal review done by the credential 
  scheme as group at diff because you've got you know there there 
  are set of there's a set of expertise there as as well I think 
  that the key key being get as many eyes on it as possible before 
  you know it's finalized so that we can all kind of make sure that 
  people feel comfortable reusing it you know broadly uh that's it.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Perfect we're very interested in that so I'll be 
  in touch on it.
Harrison_Tang: Great 10 you're next in the queue.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Uh so a 
  couple of things um these are cautionary and suggestions towards 
  revision of what you've got there.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Um I posted a 
  couple of links up above in the chat about falsehoods that 
  program Believe uh with particular attention to be paid to Pro uh 
  falsehoods about names including that people have them.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Forced in use 
  of quote unquote a legal name.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Is 
  problematic as Facebook learned a number of years ago.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): People must 
  be able to use pseudonyms and there's I can see no reason why 
  that shouldn't be possible in what you're building here.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I would also.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Suggest that 
  instead of requiring a legal name you require illegal name and or 
  X Y and Z whatever other attributes are useful for this or a 
  chosen for this.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): Such that 
  people don't have to use their legal name for purposes of these 
  these credentials.
TallTed_//_Ted_Thibodeau_(he/him)_(OpenLinkSw.com): I think 
  that's it.
Harrison_Tang: Great thanks Carrie.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hey there I'm laughing at the uh the slide that's 
  up right now that's pretty great thank you um and we definitely 
  need those so it's awesome um I I have 1 question about.
Kerri Lemoie:  Address and the requirement to have at least a 
  place of birth I was wondering where like what what was the 
  justification for thinking that and also like what is meant by 
  place of birth.
Kerri Lemoie:  How precise is that supposed to be what what's the 
  intention of of that um because I can think of uh I think of 
  situations where.
<dmitri_zagidulin> i was wondering that too, re place of birth
Kerri Lemoie:  I don't know when when context is a libraries 
  right libraries May provide present credentials to their patrons 
  right and their Communications who go to libraries I don't have 
  addresses um or maybe even know their place of birth so I'm just 
  curious about like where that came from and and why that decision 
  was made.
<dmitri_zagidulin> LOTS of people where that's not known
<dmitri_zagidulin> just take address out of the minimal
Nate Otto:  Yes so um yeah so just just to set the context right 
  it it is it is a a kyc for financial services focused type of of 
  credential schema and so we try to do is try to have the the very 
  minimum set of fields that it that you do need for requiring an 
  individual identifying an individual sorry for kyc purposes um 
  now we've centered on the very very minimum set of fields um you 
  know you if you're implementing this you know in a particular 
  country or or so on you may require more Fields um but the very 
  minimum 1 that is required it is a place of birth uh and so in 
  that type of situation you may just you know for instance just 
  specify locality region and Country uh but you may not specify 
  the address or any additional Fields uh typically as I've seen it 
  uh address identifying documents don't include the full address 
  over the person.
Nate Otto:   Was born but maybe just.
Nate Otto:  Region and Country.
Nate Otto:  Um so that's sort of the the guideline that we're 
  following uh but again you know open to feedback um if if uh a 
  different set of combination of fields would be sufficient for 
  determining the person's place of birth.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah 1 thing I want to add quickly is that 
  there's this line between you know what would be needed for um a 
  kyc you know for if if an institution is performing kyc Now 
  versus what would be something what's the future that we would 
  like to get to um you know say things like as close to 
  traditional credit scores like alternate credit signals and so I 
  think that I'm seeing this as necessary for the traditional path 
  but that it's not prescriptive in the sense that it's not meant 
  to say this is what it should look like for all future right so I 
  think um that would be addressed by different schemas and then or 
  maybe even different sort of use examples of the given schema.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks
<tallted_//_ted_thibodeau_(he/him)_(openlinksw.com)> "third tent 
  from the signpost under the bridge"? KYC should not discriminate 
  against the unhoused.
Harrison_Tang: Money do you have a follow-up comment on this.
Manu Sporny:  Oh uh yes sorry you were you were in front of me 
  though Harrison did you want to go.
Harrison_Tang: I have a different topic yeah.
Manu Sporny: 
  https://github.com/credential-handler/vc-examples/tree/main/credentials
Manu Sporny:  Okay um uh the other thought I had was it would be 
  really nice to get this thing these credentials into the 
  verifiable credential playground I don't know uh Auto if you've 
  uh thought about doing that anytime soon so there's a there's a 
  VC examples repository and there are bunch of example like 
  verifiable credentials that the community has created over the 
  last you know uh couple of years like jobs for the future and um 
  you know medical technician and alumni and movie Tech and all 
  that kind of stuff um I was wondering these initiatives in 
  general creating schemas you know for Concepts.
Manu Sporny:  Would be really nice if we could tie it to the 
  verifiable credential playground sooner than later so that we can 
  demonstrate that you know there can be multiple issues and 
  multiple verifiers of these credentials like today the the VC 
  playground I think supports like 8 10 some odd issuers they're 
  going to go up to like 15 or 16 soon when bc20 happens um have 
  you thought about like how to get this work like tighter feedback 
  loop on it like get it into get issuers multiple different types 
  of issues issuing it get multiple different types of verifiers 
  verifying it make sure that it can land in multiple different um 
  uh uh digital wallets uh any any thoughts on like at what point 
  during the process do you do that.
Nate Otto:  So I mean currently we have um 1 ID and and Privado 
  being the the main ones that are using this but um I don't know 
  Kim I guess we we fairly flexible in that regard as to.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Definitely um yes we so as to mention there's 
  the the current issuers Jim sharing who is the other.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Has been socializing around to get additional 
  you know feedback from implementers I like the idea of 
  introducing maybe a tight uh uh feedback loop between the div 
  schemas and the VC playground and so let me take a look at you 
  know what we're dealing with it would be nice if there's 
  something that we could make um you know easy to uh reference 
  each other on both sides but not like the risk would be schemas 
  getting out of date or you know just making sure there's a way we 
  can integrate easily I think that would be fantastic so this 
  sounds like a good follow-up item um for you and me man.
Harrison_Tang: Uh so I have a question in regards to the contact 
  channels object like I'm my question is like why is it contact 
  channels type and contact identifier instead of just uh spell it 
  out like email phone addresses.
Harrison_Tang: Is it just to be flexible or like what's the 
  thought process here.
Nate Otto:  Or yeah to allow for several because you you want to 
  allow several entries and so it could be just work email personal 
  email personal phone whereas if you just uh have specific fields 
  for each of them then you end up needing to add more entries for 
  it and so just having this enumeration here gives us the 
  flexibility of having multiple entries in that array.
<dmitri_zagidulin> thats how vCard does it too
Nate Otto:  And just keeps it consistent with you know the rest 
  of just like you see here like there's several entries for names 
  several entries for address several entries for identifiers so we 
  just thought from a consistency standpoint that is not to say 
  that in a specific implementation you could change it right again 
  like the.
Nate Otto:  Uh this is just a reference here and then you know if 
  within your ecosystem you find that perhaps you are more 
  comfortable just having these directly in there that's you know 
  that's a sort of ecosystem identity ecosystem decision.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah so so based on my experience I would suggest 
  to flatten it out and here's the reason the reason is because uh 
  as Spokeo for example we have both the web team and data team and 
  the web team loves to use Json objects and the nested structures 
  but the data team when they you know data team mostly work with 
  data frames right or tables like spreadsheets it's 2-dimensional 
  but when you Nest it too much on the Json object you encounter 
  what's called orm object relational model mapping right and then 
  the they will it's it's really really complicated imagining you 
  are mapping uh 4 dimensional tensor right which is 4 dimensional 
  Matrix but it's called tensor um 4 dimensional tensor to a 2 
  dimensional spreadsheet like you'll have nested and repeated 
  Fields it's it's it's going to be really really complicated so I 
  would suggest to flatten it out and actually do a person emails 
  and all that stuff otherwise asking the data team if if the 1.
Harrison_Tang:  the end user.
Harrison_Tang: Check is the data teams they will have a huge 
  headache and it will be a you will always have informational loss 
  when you map from a high dimensional space to a lower dimensional 
  to dimensional space.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I think we need to take it back to the group I 
  mean I see what you're saying but I think for us there's this 
  difference between the abstract data model and then the specific 
  encoding so I don't you know if it's possible that that's sort of 
  addressed right um and you know just in terms of.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  You're doing something like writing a um a 
  schema.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  How do you say like.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  There's a term I'm thinking of oh I like Json 
  schema or something where you're saying like these builds are 
  required there there's a lot of considerations that might argue 
  for the sort of flattened um um you know schema so it's possible 
  that that's explaining the difference but we can we have a 
  meeting right after this and we can talk about that more.
<kim_duffy> we're running llow on time
Harrison_Tang: Yeah I I think based on my like 10 years like I 
  mean this this problem is uh actually much bigger and harder than 
  I originally thought like um this or in problem and uh based on 
  my experience essentially the web team want to model the data as 
  accurately as possible using nested objects and then the data 
  team they they can only not can but they mostly work with 2 
  dimensional spreadsheets so there should be a compromise and the 
  compromise in my opinion is you want to Nest the only up to like 
  3 or 4 and that's it like you don't want to go too far yeah.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So we're running kind of low on time um and 
  hoping we can get to the rest so we mentioned um proof of 
  personhood and the context of this 1 and proof of personhood is 
  is um 1 of I'll call it 1 of the schemas that we're focused on 
  but the problem is a lot more complex than that so um I title 
  this section I don't use my driver's license to browse the web 
  and I don't plan to start now and I created this image to put 
  some fear into you so um this is the future we want to avoid uh 
  next slide please.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Okay so what is this problem of uh proof of 
  personhood that we're talking about this is a discussion is 
  familiar within this group but just to make it very precise AI uh 
  can now break loan to high-end identity verification techniques 
  used on the web that's at the low end that's capta basically what 
  uh companies service providers use to.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  High-end that would be say uh selfies videos uh 
  to show that you're alive human person so both of those are 
  broken um I consider the Urgent problem at the low end and it's 
  because you know certainly we just we don't have a whole lot of 
  rigor and you'll even notice it say if the personhood credentials 
  paper uh you know which I was on myself and and I just want to 
  make sure that the the paper has a lot of ground to cover there's 
  a lot to unpack so we had to make some simplifications but 1 of 
  the areas that I see as an urgent takeaway is a need for rigor 
  around the specific use cases in the risks that we're addressing 
  so if we're talking about um you know replacing a capture that's 
  a different set of risks and concerns than if we're talking about 
  interacting on a social media platform and say proving that 
  you're human just.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  You're not spreading misinformation so we need 
  fit for purpose solutions for and we need to define the problems.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The specific concern is that misuse or overreach 
  can lead to extreme privacy risks and will also need regulatory 
  support for sure but we need technical ways to make knowing 
  nothing or knowing very little of the default next slide please.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Okay so the way I see it is this if the current 
  techniques are broken if if service providers can no longer rely 
  on capture recapture Etc then they'll need to use something and 
  simultaneously we have mobile driver's license rolling out but 
  mobile driver's license were not designed for this next slide.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um so if you think about how you use your 
  driver's license today.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Their uh in general 2 types so in-person or 
  1-on-1 interactions that would be used in face-to-face use cases 
  where that General expectation is that no 1 is spying on you or 
  recording it unless say their law enforcement officer something 
  like that.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um so in general you do not expect that.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   You know.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So Random other people are are looking at your 
  driver's license knowing that attaching additional information 
  about your activities and this is a huge risk um so you know it's 
  so that's the the getting access to um age restricted um items in 
  person but the other use case would be high Assurance use case so 
  high trust examples I argue that these are not so much the 
  biggest concern for um you know for proof of personhood because 
  you will be having to use some high Assurance like say maybe 
  whether it's a mobile driver's license combined with some other 
  techniques.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I think the other thing to call out though is 
  that when you use your driver's license today there are strong 
  privacy expectations and even mandates.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And the web as we know it right now um we know 
  and I know from my daily data breach notifications that I can't 
  count on companies to protect my data so when the PHD paper came 
  out already um you know I have daily people telling me Oh we 
  could just use mobile driver's license for this no you can't and 
  the reason is that companies can't be trusted to custody that 
  data and the Assurance is provided by the mobile driver's license 
  a signature it doesn't provide the um you know anonymity or 
  pseudonymity characteristics we need so mobile driver's license 
  you could conceivably see as being a part of it as we were 
  talking about earlier if you have um you know if something is 
  wrapped in a zkp something like that um you know that that could 
  work but then also uh next slide I think um.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So um in some cases maybe you don't even need a 
  identity document so say on the lower end if the if the 
  requirement is just capture replacement probe your real human and 
  nothing more it's possible that you're not even worried about 
  anchoring in a person you know some sort of issued credential 
  maybe it's okay that you are preventing a abused systemwide maybe 
  your system can tolerate some upper bound of you know Shenanigans 
  robotic actions so I think 1 of the biggest priorities is to uh 
  further develop what we mean by this uh you know proof of 
  personhood what we're getting at here and explore relaxing 
  requirements for in the in the PHD paper.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Know which we I think we have the the lead 
  author of that command soon so a little articulate the uh the 
  main thing but the the idea of it is to prove your real human 
  nothing more and it developed a set of requirements for some of 
  these more uh higher Stakes use cases within it.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  We can explore relaxing some of the requirements 
  such as the requirement of 1 um credential per issuer per uh per 
  person per issuer um maybe it's just some more systemwide things 
  so what is diff doing.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  We are uh working on a personhood credential 
  schemas in the the working group but that's probably 1 of the 
  least interesting parts of it so another aspect is where 
  laboratory and use cases and risks and I think the um on the next 
  slide we'll see examples of those we're also investing in um the 
  broad area of SSI and zkp so um for example partnering with 
  ethereum Foundation uh privacy scaling exploration on what 
  they're doing with a non-adoption which are very similar to the 
  Google uh demonstration of wrapping in mdl and a zkp next slide 
  please.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So when I talk about use cases in Risk 
  Frameworks I mean um you know what are these use of the use cases 
  for example talked about in the PHD paper and then much Beyond um 
  you know are we talking about AI bot prevention and we talking 
  about the age verification civil resistance voting what are the 
  risks that we're trying to uh um introduced and what are the what 
  are the risks we're trying to combat and what are the risks we 
  also introduced um and so this argues for uh uh.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   You know.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Reducing the amount of requirements because the 
  more um identity sort of more specific you get in identity 
  verification the easier it can get to track people's behavior.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um so also defining PhD types semantics refining 
  the issuing criteria.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And next slide please I think we're getting to 
  the end.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um yes and then um.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I think the other aspect is that we're sorry I 
  grabbed some of these slides from another thing um but but yeah 
  so I think.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Teasing through concerns like are their 
  introductions of dependence on the issuer linkability um it does 
  seem that there's a lot of growing awareness around the privacy 
  concerns of mdls there um that was a much that was much discussed 
  at IBEW here's some references here next slide I think this 
  should be the end um yeah so if you're interested in working on 
  this join us like be great to work with you on this.
Harrison_Tang: Great thank you thanks Ken uh any questions I 
  think we still have time for 1 2 questions.
Harrison_Tang: Alright great well thank you thank you Kim for a 
  great presentation thanks Aldo uh for great presentation as well 
  so if there's no further questions uh thanks again uh for a great 
  presentation and leading a great discussion.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks!!
Nate Otto:  Awesome thank you so much and we're happy to work 
  across you know standards orgs and and and collaborate to make uh 
  decentralized automated reality.
Harrison_Tang: Definitely thanks a lot have a good 1 uh this 
  concludes this week's ccg meeting thanks.

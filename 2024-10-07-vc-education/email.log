  haven't been.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So this week uh any any other uh 
  announcements.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so this week uh we're going to be 
  talking about the diff hackathon and I see Kim has just joined us 
  so uh Kim without too much further Preamble uh I want to hand it 
  over to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If your audio connected.
<pl> ePIC - https://epic.openrecognition.org/
<kerri_lemoie> Hi All - I'm here listening but sick today so 
  staying off audio
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh Carrie has uh added in chat that uh.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Has found it sorry it didn't.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh no problem.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I've been having some issues this morning 
  getting uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  No problem I'm glad to have you.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Thank you thanks for giving me the time.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um let me see if I can pull it up now.
Geun-Hyung Kim: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ExHPu2sAphNKDvZ8Wo6gRSJPeHbjX7Ks/edit#slide=id.p1
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And I'll share I guess I didn't set the 
  permissions broadly enough so I'll share this right after.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The meeting or the sorry set the permissions 
  correctly right after sending this for reference so let me pull 
  up the slide deck.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Okay so we are here today to talk about the 
  future of education and Workforce challenge set and uh this is a 
  track that sponsored by jmf and DCC and it's part of the diff 
  hackathon and for context so the diff hackathon is um it just 
  started so it's not too late to get involved and in general our 
  key objectives are to promote interoperability and Adoption of 
  decentralized identity standards.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  We are really focused on what transformation is 
  possible when you are building on technology that uses 
  decentralized identity principles and human Centric Solutions the 
  things we've been really building towards many years now.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And then also demonstrate real world use cases 
  the other thing is that we're very keen to promote awareness and 
  growth and alignment of communities within focusing on on similar 
  challenges so we have a great set of sponsors this year including 
  DCC and JF Labs who've made the uh education future of Education 
  Workforce track possible.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Now before we go into the details just some um.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Kim super quick uh super quick interrupt uh 
  the slide deck uh which is so kindly shared is is Access Control 
  do you mind uh if you or I can also do it uh share it to view.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah I'm doing it right now.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I just needed a break in talking so yeah.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So in and then for context um you know a lot of 
  the work in the VC edu Community comes from our sort of shared 
  interest in pushing forward as Society or decentralized identity 
  standards and education and Workforce and so Sharon and Carrie 
  have been um heavily or uniquely involved in pushing for the jmf 
  plugfest which has been huge for promoting actual demonstrable 
  interoperability in decentralized identity Solutions so you know 
  we've all been building for many years on these base standards 
  like verifiable credentials decentralized identifiers take your 
  pick of of um issuance and exchange protocols.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  But the work of defining profiles and um 
  enabling.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  People from different organizations to actually.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um Implement against the profiles thereby 
  showing here's a wallet that actually can talk to multiple 
  issuers can talk to multiple verifiers um Etc that work has been 
  huge and actually demonstrating the the uh promise of 
  interoperability that we've been um you know designing towards so 
  through jmf plugfest again that's Sharon and Carrie of DCC have 
  been doing the a lot of the great work there um have helped push 
  forward Open Standards and education and Workforce it uses uh VCS 
  and um specifically the open badges 3.0 standard that this group 
  The VCU Community has been instrumental in uh aligning towards so 
  getting the VC's getting open badges to be a VC in this work of 
  this community um some of the standards that are used in jmf 
  plug.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Stack the open ID based stack and so being able 
  to demonstrate that multiple um issuers relying parties Etc can 
  um Implement uh interoperability.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And then some of the artifacts output from that 
  include the credential issuance and verification playgrounds um I 
  yeah I think it's called credential playground or credentials 
  something uh there have been wallet implementations and schemas 
  that are output from that.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So what we wanted to do with the future of 
  education and Workforce track.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   Sort of.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Build on the GFF success meaning um we've 
  already done or this community has already done all the hard work 
  of figuring out what are those profiles that can achieve 
  interoperability and what are these tool sets and starting points 
  of schemas so many people when they're coming into a 
  decentralized identity hackathon they're figuring things out from 
  scratch do I use uh you know varamo or do I use some other tool 
  set and how do I make a verifiable credential and how do I piece 
  together all of this so 1 advantage of all the work that's done 
  with jmf is that participants can just refer to the profiles the 
  tool sets and everything and so when talking to to Sharon and 
  Carrie about this we were really excited by the idea of we can 
  use the hackathon to push forward the work of the jmf plug.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Also that participants would tremendously 
  benefit from it because they would be able to uh they'd have a 
  leg up kind of in terms of the ability to start knowing like 
  these are the tools that I use but then also they can be more 
  confident that the solutions that they're building are useful to 
  this community in that whatever they're building might actually 
  be a plug going to uh um employment systems um you know think 
  things like this or or creating entirely new uh say plugins to to 
  um um employment and hiring systems so.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The way it's just divided is as a few sort of 
  tracks within the overall challenge that.
<pl> Credential playground: https://vcplayground.org/
Geun-Hyung Kim:  1 Is called verifiable learner worker IDs and 
  Records we we'll get into details of each of them uh the next is 
  powerful new VC tools another is feature enhancement of the the.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Sort of artifacts developed by this community 
  and then the last 1 is a bonus design Challenge and establishing 
  credibility in digital credentials so where the digital 
  credentials meet the human world.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So to get into details.
<sharon_leu_|_jff_labs> Based on data from our national job 
  seeker survey, these are the credentials that job seekers most 
  wanted in their employment wallet.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The Challenge 1 is very open-ended it's saying 
  well all of these have as a requirement to use the jmf profiles 
  and to if desired use the the tool sets that were developed but 
  the first challenge is to say you know if you have a world like 
  this where Learners and workers can control their identification 
  like student IDs and other records a history of employment things 
  like that what can you build and so the idea here is to let 
  participants use their imagination to build some kind of tools 
  where people um can achieve real economic um uh Mobility or you 
  know get a new opportunity from a job find some um educational 
  courses that they need to reach the next level so basically use 
  their imagination to demonstrate what's possible.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Challenge set 2 is to design tools that we know 
  are possible but just you know would be tremendous for actual 
  takeoff and um you know with the the opportunity to hackathon 
  it's a good opportunity for people to say like okay here's 
  exactly a tool that would be useful build it for us and it will 
  enable all these opportunities so uh 1 is to implement multiple 
  language support.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  That is possible with the with VCS to you know 
  Express them in different languages but this is about building a 
  tool to help facilitate that and um we're actually focusing a lot 
  on this render method attribute so uh getting real world 
  implementations of that and the focus on non-latin Script support 
  which is strictly harder another is browser integration so 
  building say VC display and verification tooling into the browser 
  in the work here would be to build a browser plug-in plug-in and 
  this also uses the vendor method attribute.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Lastly we have challenged 3 which is feature 
  enhancement it needs to add features to the learner credential 
  wallet which would enable richer displays of credentials in the 
  in the learner credential wallet through the render method 
  attribute.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And then extension to verify or plus which would 
  allow use of the render method as well.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The last 1 I mentioned is a bonus design 
  challenge which is to establish credibility in digital 
  credentials.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And the context is that verifying digital 
  credentials involves multiple checks so checking that their 
  cryptographically sound they're not expired they're authentic but 
  1 aspect as we sort of move rely more on digital verification is 
  how do we ensure human confidence in it and many efforts have 
  attempted things like sort of breaking down what sort of checks 
  are performed are being performed.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Questions like is there um you know sort of 
  consistent expectations that we can start um pushing out and also 
  what would it look like at scale and so this is this is pretty 
  open for people for participants to.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Celebrate how they.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  But we're framing this as a bonus design 
  challenge meaning it can be stacked on top of the other 
  challenges and the winner will get an additional prize.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um we had a lot of prizes so it's a total of 
  15000 in prizes and let me see if I can make this a little bit 
  bigger.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Well too big 1 second I just learned that I can 
  do this okay.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So what I've listed here are the winners for 
  each Challenge and the 2A to be 3A 3B are uh basically to go back 
  so 2 multi this is 2A and multi language support to be browser 
  integration 3A is this 1 3 B is this and now I'm realizing 
  retrospect I could have labeled that better but um so these are 
  for the winners and then the there are also prizes for second and 
  third place and so you can see the hackathon site for more 
  details.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The requirements are basically used the jmf 
  stack and references for this so if any of you have participated 
  in the jmf plugfest before then this will be especially easy to 
  get started and we want to make clear that it's just getting 
  started the uh hackathon goes all through the month of October 
  and I think the submission deadline is actually November 4th that 
  you can see that for sure on the site so you still have a long 
  time to get started we are still having the information sessions 
  and and speaking of we have an informational session on Wednesday 
  October the 9th where um we'll be giving uh uh overview of this 
  for the hackathon crowd I have some links here so basically 
  participants so people can learn more if you know enough already.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   You want.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Register here we have additional challenge 
  details on this site.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  And um this is to uh attend the education 
  Workforce Force track we have a Discord server for the hacker 
  specifically for the hackathon purposes in the education track 
  channel is the 1 where people will ask questions specifically 
  about it but um so yeah I'm gonna stop here we're really grateful 
  for the VC uh edu Community giving us a time to present this we 
  are really excited about the idea of more sort of crossover 
  events whether it's the hackathon or other opportunities to work 
  together.
<kerri_lemoie> Much thanks to DIF for hosting this and to Kim for 
  her championing of edu & workforce VCs!
Geun-Hyung Kim:  1 Thing that people may not be familiar with 
  about if is that our main priority is promoting decentralized 
  identity standards wherever they are so we're not inserting 
  anywhere in here you must use a different thing these are all 
  actually either w3c or open ID standards um and so you know to us 
  it's really important that people build the right with the right 
  tools and standards for their community and so just want to make 
  sure people know that that we're not uh trying to lock people 
  into a different thing and that we're very um you know I 
  personally am very passionate about the work that's happened in 
  this community and um you know looking forward to doing more 
  events like this in the future.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So I'll stop with this but I should turn over to 
  any questions do we have anything teed up so far.
<kerri_lemoie> Kim - should we talk about how DevPost works since 
  many may not be familiar with it?
<kerri_lemoie> (sorry for not turning on mic!)
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So I have a question and um Carrie has a 
  question in chat about should we talk about how devpost Works 
  since uh people may not be familiar with it if you want to if you 
  want to talk about that but I also have a different question.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Sorry I started answering it but then realized 
  that I was on mute.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So um yeah and by the way I like the little King 
  icon that's next to you Dmitri I guess that's a new sort of 
  feature.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh yeah yes yeah that's the because I I logged 
  in as the host so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It's pretty funny though.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  I like to see all these jitsi future upgrades so 
  yeah death post is is basically we're we're only using it for the 
  submissions actually so Dev post is a platform that lets um 
  participants submit their say code Etc entries and um and they 
  actually deal with Distributing the prizes so that's really the 
  main thing that we're doing there um to use Dev posts they 
  require that you set up an account and every time that we do 
  something like this I realize it's just very rich that we're not 
  using our own tool sets right now like why aren't we using a dwn 
  based thing that we're running ourselves but in any case current 
  world we're in and we are using Dev posts they make you set up an 
  account and essentially for this track well in general what 
  they're looking for let me see I'm still sharing.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   1 Second.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So all of the tracks have the requirement to 
  provide a 3 minute video talking about what the app does in 
  providing a URL to the public code repository and and I realize 
  that doing the video for some may seem overwhelming I did I 
  participated in my first hackathon about 2 years ago and I 
  created the worst video ever that I'll actually share with you if 
  you want just so you can see like how low the bar is but um yes 
  it's to get a description from you of what you've built what 
  you're doing and um also to provide a URL to the public code 
  Repository.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  In in this track specifically we're asking that 
  you use the MIT license to be consistent with the other tooling 
  that's built in this space.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Also a text description of the products features 
  and functionality and then how requirements were used in the 
  project so for example in this specific track we have the 
  additional requirements that you have to use open badges 3.0 that 
  you have to issue credentials with uh 1 of 2 profile options 
  exchange credentials with 1 of 3 profile options um and so 
  basically describe how your uh how your submission met those 
  requirements and the nice thing about having built on jmf 
  plugfest is that you can reuse all of the tools like the VC 
  playground chappie BCC wallet and also the additional resources 
  mentioned on here.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   But yeah.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Going to be um facilitating your submission 
  asking for the description asking for the upload and the links 
  and then they would also be um Distributing the prize money as 
  well.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Any um other details about that we should get 
  into.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And is there um is there requirements about 
  new versus existing.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So yeah there is but you can use existing 
  software the out actually let me pull up the rules that have the.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Uh 1 second.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Sorry I was afraid I was sharing my wrong screen 
  um just 1 moment actually you know I'm going to go over to the.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Website to the dev post.
Geun-Hyung Kim:   So you can.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  See what it.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  This is the devpost site.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Um in in the rules.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  There should be something around that and so it 
  basically has some sort of requirement like it has to be updated 
  within some amount of time and so I can find exactly.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  What that is oh yeah so here we go new and 
  existing.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Oh here we go.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Makes sense so we don't we don't see uh that 
  table because I think you're just sharing the 1 table but but 
  you're narrating oh there we go that's that's good.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah so this is a dead post site sorry about 
  that this is a dead post site and then it's talking about how you 
  can you can use it you just have to update it and then in your 
  submission explain how it was updated during the submission 
  period.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And the spirit of the project is hey build 
  something new right.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Yeah well the spirit is build something new or 
  or.
Kerri Lemoie: +1 Building something new -- help our ecosystem 
  advance the work!
Geun-Hyung Kim:  The the I would say the overall spirit is build 
  something that is um you know really pushing forward 
  demonstrating interoperability adoption of decentralized identity 
  standards the human Centric uh thing I think that in my mind if 
  it's significantly updated I really don't think I think judges 
  don't care about that I personally will not make a distinction 
  and I can um check in with others to make sure but I do think you 
  know for example we've already seen submissions submissions that 
  were introduced in the first day and so it's like okay that 
  probably is not in the spirit of the future of Education or 
  Workforce so um yeah feel free to update and then certainly some 
  of the tracks are sort of you know like feature enhancements 
  those are actually explicitly building on on existing uh.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  So um that there are ones that are owned 
  controlled by well DCC and open Wallet Foundation as opposed to 1 
  Zone but I think for example if someone were doing were using say 
  the uh previously implemented solution in an extending it for say 
  challenge 1 that could be really interesting.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Still sharing the right screen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  I think you're not sharing at the moment uh 
  but I think.
Geun-Hyung Kim:  Oh yeah sorry I just turned it off yeah.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah yeah no worries no worries uh so I think 
  Phil's on the Queue with a question.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Go ahead so.
<kim_duffy> my audio cut off
<pl> Thanks Kim
<kerri_lemoie> When will the HR Open VC version standard be 
  public?
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks Phil!
Kerri Lemoie: +1 Kim

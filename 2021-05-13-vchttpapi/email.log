Markus Sabadello is scribing.
Manu Sporny:  Agenda is PRs first, then talk about use cases
Manu Sporny:  We have a number of use cases we want to go through
Manu Sporny:  Any updates to the agenda?

Topic: Review of Pull Requests

Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pulls
Manu Sporny:  We have 2 PRs, both are attempting to apply last 
  week's resolutions
Manu Sporny:  First one is by markus_sabadello
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/178
Markus Sabadello:  Yes, this PR proposes to split up the OpenAPI 
  specificationf ile into three separate OpenAPI specification 
  files plus a few additional ones. The idea is to try and separate 
  issuer, verifier, holder related APIs into separate files. To 
  make it easier to manage different areas of functionality. 
  [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
Markus Sabadello:  The file has been getting larger and larger, 
  with the addition of potential holder APIs, it's become even more 
  complex, so the idea was to split this up to separate areas. 
  There are some shared schemas as well. [scribe assist by Manu 
  Sporny]
Orie Steele: There are also: "Internal Holder" and "External 
  Holder / Exchange APIs"
Markus Sabadello:  Verifiable Credential, Verifiable 
  Presentation, for example. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
<orie> this was part of the contention on the previous PR
Markus Sabadello:  The goal was to make everything more modular, 
  there was support for this, and resolution was done so this puts 
  it into practice. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]
<orie> Markus' PR takes us in a good direction towards making 
  this clearer
Manu Sporny:  I agree, I have seen a lot of support and PR 
  approvals
Manu Sporny:  Suggestion is to merge immediately
Mike Prorock:  Thanks to markus_sabadello , this will make future 
  PRs much cleaner
Manu Sporny:  YAML files are really helpful to be concise about 
  endpoint inputs. Ideally we would fine a way to process those 
  YAML files and inject them into Respec
Orie Steele: Here is an example: 
  https://or13.github.io/traceability-api/
Manu Sporny:  Orie, any thoughts on this?
Orie Steele: Example: 
  https://github.com/OR13/traceability-api/blob/main/docs/index.html#L139
Adrian Gropper:  I think it's worth putting in the minutes that I 
  was a hold out from this decision process. There is an issue that 
  I hope we are all aware of an issue.. As a self-sovereign 
  resource holder, when I go to the issuer, I should have the 
  choice to get either a VC or a capability.
Adrian Gropper:  I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
Adrian Gropper:  If the process prevents me from getting a 
  capability (and only a VC), this will have major repercussions
Mike Prorock:  In terms of pulling Respec in, Orie linked an 
  example in the spec. There are two things
Mrporock: One is interactive OpenAPI documentation. Those YAML 
  file can be merged into a master YAML file and then sectioned out
Mike Prorock:  This can then be pulled into Respec as shown by 
  Orie's link
Manu Sporny:  My concern is there are details here when pulling 
  big chunks of Respec
Manu Sporny:  My hope is we could do some pre-processing of a 
  JSON structure and write a tiny Respec extension
Manu Sporny:  Ensure we keep YAML and Respec in sync.
Mike Prorock:  Sometimes there are benefits with using JSON. I 
  might open an issue/PR
Manu Sporny:  You outlined two things. First, you want to get a 
  VC from the issuer; the API supports this today.
Manu Sporny:  And, you as the caller can be an organization or an 
  individual. You could be an individual with your own 
  infastructure that is in full control of the API.
Adrian Gropper:  Full sovereignty to me means when I get to 
  delegate what happens relative to the issuer.
Manu Sporny:  Currently, you can have full control over the 
  entire infrastructure, you can run all of it.
Manu Sporny:  Now let's talk about delegation
Manu Sporny:  Delegation is part of the authorization framework, 
  and we haven't had this discussion.
<orie> can we agree not to pull in authorization capabilities 
  into this API?... I feel like thats a huge can of worms and is 
  incompatible with the "Internal Endpoints"....
Manu Sporny:  My expectation is some companies will support 
  delegation to the API; one way is GNAP, another is ZCAP.
<orie> GNAP and ZCAPs are both drafts..... huge -1 to assuming 
  them in any way.
Manu Sporny:  We can allow this in the API. It may be an 
  extension rather than first-class feature.
<orie> but certainly GNAP and ZCaps are possible solutions to 
  "External Holder" scenarios
Manu Sporny:  To discuss those things are in scope. There are 
  people working on it.
Adrian Gropper:  I will voice strong objection to the idea that 
  this will be an extension rather than core. The reason is 
  asymmetry of power between issuers and subjects.
Adrian Gropper:  If we make this an extension, the asymmetry will 
  become regulatory capture.
Adrian Gropper:  Since we are at the beginning, we don't have to 
  go down that path. We have everything we need in the 
  spec/protocol work that we could address (channelling Alan Karp) 
  justice and good design, right now from the beginning.
Orie Steele:  We have to be careful when talking about capability 
  systems, and these APIs. There are two different meanings of 
  APIs.
Orie Steele:  There are "internal" holder APIs, that help you 
  make a presentation using a web service.
Orie Steele:  This is different from talking to an "external" 
  party.
Orie Steele:  To date, we have only had internal APIs. The PR 
  that spawned this discussion was the first time an external API 
  was proposed
Orie Steele:  GNAP / ZCAP is probably not appropriate for 
  internal APIs, since in an internal domain there is no 
  sovereignty, it's just app infrastructure.
Adrian Gropper: +1 Orie also GNAP will likely not discriminate 
  between ZCAPS, biscuits, or macaroons
Manu Sporny:  Markus' PR is going to go int.
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/183
Manu Sporny:  The other PR is to create the initial structure of 
  the spec.
Manu Sporny:  I will share screen to show what the spec looks 
  like
Manu Sporny:  The PR would create the spec, a large part is 
  blank.
Manu Sporny:  The PR just has some proposals what the sections 
  are.
Mike Prorock: +1 Initial structure to allow documentation
Manu Sporny:  It is taking action on a recent resolution, so the 
  suggestion is to merge it shortly.
Manu Sporny:  Any questions/concerns about the PRs?

Topic: Use Cases

<juan_caballero> thanks for doing that manu!
Manu Sporny: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-u0_Ub6feiX6DH3jXFJFjt6n3CwKGpkmC3VISqDkWL4/edit#
Manu Sporny:  Here is the use cases document
Manu Sporny:  Juan has cleaned up the landing page, it has 
  instructions and pointers on how to write use cases. Also has a 
  proposed timeline.
Juan Caballero:  I hope people put the emphasis on the right part 
  of the use cases. Do not miss the link to Joe's email.
Juan Caballero:  In the doc's version history, you can see a 
  shorter use case, and then a longer one by Joe.
Juan Caballero:  If anyone submits use cases, you can replay the 
  process you see in the version history.
Juan Caballero:  Use cases of the length of Adrian and Manu that 
  really emphasize the real-world stakeholders and processes, 
  rather than the technical steps.
Juan Caballero:  The API is specifying a neutral cross-vendor 
  general-purpose API.
Juan Caballero:  I'd like to try emphasize incorporating some of 
  the VC use cases, highlighting what is gained from vendors not 
  having to invent their own bespoke APIs. This should be 
  emphasized.
Eric_Schuh: That was great Juan, we're in alignment.
Eric_Schuh: I added a proposed timeline, would like to get some 
  thoughts if 4 weeks seem like a reasonable amount of time.
Manu Sporny:  I think the timeline is great, for a first pass. 
  This doesn't mean you can't add more use cases after June 10th. 
  Let's try to get the major use cases in by then.
<juan_caballero> minimum viable usecase set to structure and 
  facilitate manu's skeleton spec being fleshed out!
<eric_schuh> timeline can always change if we feel like we need 
  more time, of course
Manu Sporny:  My experience is you only need 15-30 minutes to get 
  something in.
Manu Sporny:  +1 To the proposed timeline.
Manu Sporny:  Happy to run a proposal
Manu Sporny:  Any other comments on gathering use cases?
Manu Sporny:  Let's try to spend some time talking about 
  everybody's use cases, let's go in order
Manu Sporny:  Agropper you wrote a digital vaccination use case? 
  Can you introduce it and how it impacts the VC HTTP API?

PROPOSAL:  Use Case initial timeline will be

Adrian Gropper:  This is a real-world use case I am involved in. 
  The use case points out the asymmetric relationship between the 
  issuer (doing the vaccination) and the person receiving the 
  vaccination (could be an undocumented person). That person wants 
  to be sure there is no central registry. In some administrations, 
  that could impact their immigrant status.
Adrian Gropper:  The second aspect is how the privacy-preserving 
  Verifiable Credential is delivered to Allie. That is her/his 
  choice (e.g. take photo, or use email, text message, CHAPI, etc.)
<orie> i guess this use case assume that the data model is not 
  HL7/FHIR / attached to an existing patient record?
Adrian Gropper:  From the self-sovereignty perspective, as far as 
  the spec is concerned, all of those are in scope. Unless the 
  issuer has a really good reason, they don't get to discriminate 
  the way of receiving the credential is being used.
Adrian Gropper:  This is not the same as the earlier issue 
  regarding capabilities.
Manu Sporny:  Any comments from anyone in the group?
<orie> This use case belongs in the vaccnination vocab work item
Manu Sporny:  It's a good use case, the value is clear. I 
  couldn't draw a straight line from the use case to the VC HTTP 
  API. This use case could also live in other documents. What makes 
  this a VC HTTP API use case?
Adrian Gropper:  Both the form how the credential is filled out, 
  and the way how it gets delivered, that's HTTP.
Adrian Gropper:  She should be able to do this entirely over 
  HTTP.
Orie Steele:  I think that is the connection. In my mind what's 
  tricky about the use case is some assertions about the 
  cross-trust domain aspect of the issuer/holder relationship.
Orie Steele:  I think some parts of this is about presentation 
  exchange, rather than VC HTTP API.
Orie Steele:  This is in no way related to the Issuance API, 
  which just produces credentials and is considered internal.
Orie Steele:  The part of the use case that covers the VC HTTP 
  API is that holders can see issuers that provide credentials with 
  certain privacy characteristics.
Orie Steele: So in summary: adrian's use case is relevant to 
  external holder apis only.
Manu Sporny:  Adrian, the HTTP form aspect has nothing to do with 
  the VC HTTP API.
Manu Sporny:  The second thing might be related to the VC HTTP 
  API, but for me there is not enough data to understand what 
  specific call of the VC HTTP API returns something to Allie.
<orie> and the "internal issuance apis" in the sense that every 
  VC is related to them.
Mike Prorock:  You basically said my concern. Just because the 
  user interaction is over the web, that doesn't necessarily imply 
  it has anything to do with the VC HTTP API.
Mike Prorock:  It's a totally valid use case, I'm not sure what 
  is novel about it for the VC HTTP API itself.
<adrian_gropper> I will respond to Manu in terms of requests and 
  presentations.
Orie Steele: +1 Adrian
Adrian Gropper:  My perspective is in terms of presentation 
  requests. In GNAP we call this requests. The subject Allie is 
  making requests from the Issuer. Embedded is all sorts of stuff. 
  This is exactly why authorization and delegation are first-class 
  citizens in what we are doing here.
Adrian Gropper:  GNAP cares about how you phrase a request. 
  Someone shows up at an authorization server to get something that 
  will be of use (e.g. access token, or capability, or VC).
<orie> what you get back from VC HTTP API is a VC tho... this 
  isn't the ask for anything api...
<orie> this API supports the W3C VC Data Model
<juan_caballero> ^^
Adrian Gropper:  The fact that the request comes in to a form may 
  be a stretch.
Adrian Gropper:  The point I am making is that it is a request, 
  and the result is the issuance of something.
Orie Steele:  Adrian's use case is the same use cases as in the 
  Traceability API.
Adrian Gropper: +1 Orie
Juan Caballero: +1
Orie Steele:  Proposal that the VC HTTP API that the holder can 
  request and receive a presentation. This is about presentation 
  exchange. Verifiable presentations moving across trust boundaries 
  between parties.
<mprorock> thanks @orie - that is extremely helpful and makes it 
  much more clear to me
Orie Steele:  There were proposals to include this, but people 
  asked for use cases. Now here is a use case.
Orie Steele:  We've had a resolution to expand this work item to 
  include cross trust domain contexts.
<adrian_gropper> Presentation or capability... the result is the 
  same
<mprorock> i think the wording was throwing me off
<orie> yea, stop saying capabilities
Juan Caballero: :D
<orie> probably would help
<juan_caballero> names a specific solution-- maybe just call them 
  authorizations, even if the vagueness offends you to the core?
<orie> this API doesn't return objects that are not directly 
  related to the W3C VC Data Model TR....
<orie> we will hit a scope issue if we cross that line.
<adrian_gropper> q
Manu Sporny:  Trying to re-state Adrian's use case. Flow diagram 
  would help. The idea is Allie says "I would like to start a 
  presentation flow with you", they contact the Issuer, the issuer 
  responds "you have to give me e.g. first name, last name, PIN 
  code", and maybe Allie responds back with a self-issued VC with 
  first name, last name, then the Issuer matches this against a 
  file so it will respond with a VC (digital vaccination card).
Juan Caballero: @Adrian a 5min way of making a swimlane is using 
  this website:
<juan_caballero> would be greatly appreciated!
Manu Sporny:  I think this meets Adrian's requirement and 
  illustrates how the use case is linked to the VC HTTP API.
Manu Sporny:  This is one of the next use cases that we do have a 
  flow diagram for.
<orie> pretty sure we already have a flow diagram for this
<orie> ...
Manu Sporny: If we do, it's going to be easy :)
Juan Caballero:  I think everyone's asking to shift the 
  proportions of the use case to focus on the API part rather than 
  the VC parts.
Juan Caballero:  Adrian I get the sense you want certain 
  architectures not to be blocked by the API work. A swimlane would 
  help people edit with you.
Orie Steele: -1 Adrian
<orie> thats not how VC's work
Manu Sporny: Yeah, big -1
Adrian Gropper:  I use a lot of swimlanes, but here's the thing.. 
  Orie put his finger on it. If the interaction between Allie and 
  the Issuer is going to result in a presentation, then that 
  verifiable presentation might as well go directly from the Issuer 
  to the Verifier. That's how we use "presentation" in this world.
<manu_sporny> that's definitely not how we think about things 
  here -- scary phone home issues w/ issuer direct to verifier.
Adrian Gropper:  Wheter we use capabilities and attenuations, or 
  if it's done by going through a holder and PIN codes, is 
  irrelevant.
Joe Andrieu:  I think Adrian's perspective has a pretty big 
  divergence from the work flow that I understand.
Joe Andrieu:  I was surprised to hear you talk about the Issuer 
  giving something directly to the Verifier.
Joe Andrieu:  How to you ensure consent that way? That's why the 
  holder is in the loop.
Adrian Gropper:  If you read the use, it states that the VC 
  includes a hash. There is absolutely no doubt on the Issuer and 
  Verifier side that they are talking about Allie.
S/use/use case/
Manu Sporny:  I wanted to talk about the Permanent Resident Card 
  use case.
Manu Sporny:  There is a diagram about the flow.
Manu Sporny:  There is a new presentation-based flow, I believe 
  Orie added something;
Orie Steele:  We are talking about the three roles that 
  individuals can play in different situations (issuer, holder, 
  verifier). One of the flows of the API is a presentation of 
  credentials about a subject, to a holder.
Orie Steele:  Typically the story is that an Issuer gives 
  something to a Holder. Instead of making the use cases 
  vertical-specific, I wrote the use cases in way that explains the 
  operations you need to get credentials from issuer->holder, and 
  holder->verifier. Both cross a trust domain.
Orie Steele:  There are few points here. E.g. Subject binding in 
  credential, and privacy implications. Something we talk about 
  this in the sense of subject == holder.
Juan Caballero: 
  https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-is-the-holder
Orie Steele:  Use case: Verifiable credential issued by a vet 
  about my dog. I'm the holder but I'm not the subject.
Orie Steele:  There is a presentation from someone who is holding 
  it, to a verifier. This is external-facing.
Adrian Gropper:  To Orie's use case, there are 3 cross domain 
  relationships: issuer->holder, holder->verifier, 
  issuer->verifier.
Adrian Gropper:  I agree with Orie this is all about the 
  externalization.
<> verifier when a holder is not involved... unless I am talking 
  about dystopian tracking futures.
<manu_sporny>	q+ on issuer -> verifier
Adrian Gropper:  I associate this with GNAP and delegation 
  issues. One example is the difference of having someone also 
  check your passport when they see your vaccination card.
Adrian Gropper:  In the use case I propose, Allie doesn't need to 
  have a passport at all.
Adrian Gropper:  In the dog example, the assumption is that Allie 
  presents a passport
Adrian Gropper:  All three trust relationships always exist, we 
  don't get to choose that in this group.
<> verifier is supported by the W3C VC Data Model TR?
Manu Sporny:  Adrian the third one is a very dangerous area. I 
  think I share Orie's and Joe's concerns about Issuers talking 
  directly to Verifiers. There are use cases for this, but it's 
  dangerous and we have to be careful.
<adrian_gropper> It's dangerous not to allow delegation from the 
  satrt
Manu Sporny:  Next steps, please add use cases to the document!
<eric_schuh> I can hold it for next week
<juan_caballero> run it!

PROPOSAL:  Use Case initial timeline will be

<mprorock> can we run that proposal now
Adrian Gropper: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Juan Caballero: +1
Manu Sporny: +1
Orie Steele: +1 To having timeliness
Markus Sabadello: +1
Joe Andrieu: +1

RESOLUTION: Use Case initial timeline will be: 4 weeks gathering 
  use cases & retro-documenting existing OAS filesâ€™ use-cases 
  (June 10 deadline) and then 4 weeks to distill with a goal of 
  finishing that process by the July 8 meeting.

Orie Steele:  I think we should attack the challenge Adrian has 
  put forward. I agree with everything he said, we can draw an 
  arrow between Issuer and Verifier. We should review the relevant 
  sections in the VC data model spec.
Orie Steele:  Let's work on this on issues and spec text.
<juan_caballero> thanks all
Manu Sporny:  Thanks everyone, see everyone next week.
Manu Sporny:  Will send out Doodle poll.

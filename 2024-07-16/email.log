Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Kimberly Linson:  We are very excited um Manu is not here just 
  oh.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah let me start the recording now.
Harrison_Tang: All right you're good.
Kimberly Linson:  Awesome great thanks Manu is not here just to 
  help me solve my technical challenges today um he's actually here 
  to talk to us about something I know we're all very very 
  interested in which is the California DMV open credential 
  platform um I am very excited to hear what he has to say so let's 
  go ahead and get through uh our.
Kimberly Linson:  Agenda and or our our housekeeping items and 
  then we will turn the floor over to him uh.
Kimberly Linson:  I am betting that I could like call on some 
  folks to actually uh do the housekeeping notes for for me so as 
  I'm looking down the list I'm like should I call it but I but I 
  won't I'll just.
Kimberly Linson:  Preface that I might do that in the future.
Kimberly Linson:  First of all at welcome to today's call um I so 
  appreciate and enjoy this community I thought that the 
  conversation last week um and every week is is valuable and 
  collaborative and congenial and that is exactly what we want and 
  um we follow the code of ethics and professional conduct that's 
  set forth by the w3c and if you want to learn more about that um 
  just from a this is this is how you you write that down um it's 
  the link is in the agenda um but I really appreciate everyone's 
  um commitment to to um to that.
Kimberly Linson:  Um we welcome everyone who is here uh we're so 
  glad that you are uh made some time in your day for this meeting 
  and we welcome your uh conversation and your opinion and your 
  thoughts in this meeting.
Kimberly Linson:  If you decide that you would like to to 
  contribute um more substantially to the work items that we are uh 
  in pursuit of um then I would invite you to.
Kimberly Linson:   Go in.
Kimberly Linson:  The agenda click on the links to become a 
  member of the ccg and sign the IPR agreements um as so that you 
  can and participate fully.
Kimberly Linson:  We keep a record of these meetings uh via 
  minutes and audio you can see we have the jitsi chat going and 
  the recording um and that also allows us then to cue speakers in 
  the chat which will be the role that I'm playing today is to sort 
  of moderate this call and make sure that we get to hear from as 
  many voices as we possibly can um so if you want to add yourself 
  to the queue.
Kimberly Linson:  You do that with Q Plus if you want to remove 
  yourself Q minus uh and uh and I will do my best to to sort of 
  keep on top of that and now it is time for us to uh to welcome 
  new folks and um and folks who have maybe haven't been here for a 
  while or want to share an update as to what they're doing um it 
  is time for introductions and reintroductions do I have anybody 
  who would like to.
Kimberly Linson:   Jump on.
Kimberly Linson:  On the queue.
Kimberly Linson:  Okay well we are all old friends here today 
  then and uh I will go ahead and move to announcements and 
  reminders and if you um missed the window to introduce and 
  re-energize you can you can jump in here as any announcements and 
  reminders Clea.
Kaliya Young:  We have Internet identity top number 39 coming up 
  in October October 29 to 31.
Kaliya Young:  I think it's.
Kaliya Young:  So if you want to sign up.
Kaliya Young:  And minus um now it's a good time to register and 
  we have our.
Kaliya Young:  Digital what's it called okay um.
Kaliya Young:  Did on conference Africa happening in South 
  Africa.
Kaliya Young:  September 25 to 27 so if you know folks in the 
  region um.
Kaliya Young:  Encouraged and and you know they work in the 
  industry um please encourage them to look at the conference and 
  consider coming and getting a ticket now if they want to come 
  because we're trying to figure out if we have numbers so.
Kaliya Young:  Signaling by buying a ticket is an important thing 
  to do.
Kaliya Young: https://internetidentityworkshop.com/
Kimberly Linson:  Great thank you.
Kimberly Linson:  Uh Phil Long.
Kaliya Young: https://didunconf.africa/
PL/T3: Um want to put in a reminder that there is badge Summit 
  coming up in Boulder Colorado August 3rd through uh I think it's 
  August 3rd um through the 7th um is the full duration um the 
  Monday through Wednesday is the primary days of that week and it 
  also happens to be that the last half days is dedicated to the T3 
  mid-year meeting and projects that it's doing with respect to 
  canceling will be featured in that particular portion of the T4 
  if everything's scattered throughout that might be relevant and 
  interesting I will put the link to bed Summit in the chat thank 
  you.
Nate Otto: https://www.thebadgesummit.com/ August 5-7 in Boulder 
  CO (Including T3 Network Mid-Year Meeting)
https://ip-geolocation.apple.com
Kimberly Linson:  So I know I am not able to go and I'm really 
  disappointed about it but I understand that there's like 
  something later in August that is online is that like a repeat of 
  the sessions or.
PL/T3: Yes they have a um a combination of I believe recorded 
  presentations as well as uh live presentations virtually um.
PL/T3: Just to make the process of the in-person meeting a little 
  bit less complicated but yes I think that's correct.
Kimberly Linson:  Great thank you.
Erica Connell:  Hello happy Tuesday uh just a reminder that 
  rebooting the web of trust will be convening in Ventura 
  California in October the 7th through 11th and uh early bird uh 
  tickets are still available until August 9th with your advanced.
Erica Connell:  Paper submission by August 2nd so I'll drop the 
  link to the event right with those dates and other ticket 
  information thanks.
Kimberly Linson:  It's going to be a busy few months for 
  everybody.
<pl/t3> BADGE SUMMIT 2025
<econnell> rwot13.eventbrite.com
Kimberly Linson:  Uh all right let's see I think there's.
Manu Sporny:  Uh just an announcement around kind of where we are 
  with the verifiable credential 20 working group um we are trying 
  to wrap up almost every 1 of the specifications um this month um 
  definitely trying to finalize um the.
Manu Sporny:  Uh hey uh Clea I think you're unmuted and I can 
  hear typing sorry um uh.
Manu Sporny:   We're trying to.
<pl/t3> s/me says:
Manu Sporny:  Is the the test Suites um uh as well uh by the end 
  of this month uh which means that if you have an implementation 
  um please uh start integrating with the test Suites uh we are 
  going to try to get through um you know multiple interoperable 
  implementations as quickly as we can we already have enough to 
  meet the bar for most of the specifications but we would really 
  like to make sure that implementers have a chance to implement 
  against the the the final 1 uh to make sure that they can you 
  know they don't have any issues implementing it um and then uh we 
  can make uh a movement to basically finalize the specifications 
  um at at w3c uh technical plan area we'll go through another 
  candidate recommendation just to be like that's it we're totally 
  done we're serious uh around september um and then we'll keep 
  that open for as long as we need to um but probably like minimum 
  amount.
Manu Sporny:  Um before we ratify the the final uh standards the 
  2 0 standards um.
Manu Sporny:  So if you have an implementation please uh make 
  sure that you start integrating with the with the test Suite.
Kimberly Linson:  Thank you Benjamin.
Benjamin Young:  Relatedly we're bringing back test Suite office 
  hours um starting tomorrow at 10:00 am Eastern I'll be emailing 
  out information about.
Benjamin Young:  How you can meet with me and some other 
  developers who already have implementations.
Benjamin Young:  We can help you on board your implementation 
  there.
Kimberly Linson:  Great thank you very much and thanks for 
  sending that out to the list that'll be great.
Kimberly Linson:  Na 1 else with announcements and reminders.
Kimberly Linson:  Well do you want to take a minute on work 
  items.
Kimberly Linson:  Great so we've given them a heads up that we're 
  going to start picking on them for running the housekeeping items 
  and for making sure that they've got work items to discuss um and 
  we'll give a like sort of a long teacher pause now to see if 
  anyone wants to put themselves on the Queue to talk about work 
  items.
Kimberly Linson:  Manu thank you for jumping on this you.
Manu Sporny:  I'll I'll I'll buy it I'll be the the the canary um 
  uh so uh as many of you know we've been working on the verifiable 
  credential API probably incubating it going on 2 years now um we 
  are down to about 30 issues uh that are ready for PR but given 
  everyone so busy with the current verifiable credential 20 work 
  and the new did working group um uh movement has been slow to 
  close up those last set of issues uh however once we do that um I 
  think there is a plan to take a verifiable credential standards 
  track uh at at w3c so um if and again it's just incubated right 
  now things will change once we get it into the working group but 
  it's just kind of a heads up to the community that we do plan on 
  uh proposing that um there is also been work done on render 
  method I think we're hoping to you know make some stuff public 
  about that.
Manu Sporny:  Is clearly of interest to various communities 
  around the world and so we're trying to focus on that uh uh as 
  well um that's it.
Manu Sporny:  Sorry yeah it's a great question um uh the uh 
  agenda is usually sent out ideally on Sunday I have totally 
  messed up this week and haven't sent it out yet but every uh 
  Tuesday uh sorry what is today uh yeah it's Tuesday uh every 
  Tuesday at 3 pm Eastern is when we have our calls um and we 
  usually send uh a reminder out um every week.
Kimberly Linson:  Great any other updates on work items.
Kimberly Linson:  All right you're off the hook until next week 
  when we start calling on you.
Kimberly Linson:  I think we are now to the main agenda topic so 
  manual I'm going to give the floor to you and I'll do my best to 
  kind of keep uh keep an eye on the queue.
Manu Sporny:  All right sounds great um so uh today we're going 
  to kind of um Talk a bit about uh new open source platform called 
  open cred um that uh was uh partially funded by the uh State of 
  California uh Department of Motor Vehicles um so the California 
  DMV uh funded um partially funded the work for this platform I'll 
  give the standard disclaimer I do not represent California DMV or 
  anyone in the state or any government entity or any of that stuff 
  I'm just kind of reporting out on where the work is um uh.
Manu Sporny:  With that we can we can go in um open cred is 
  basically a it's a verifiable credential verifier implementation 
  it does verification so if we look at our 3-party model they're 
  you know issuers holders and verifiers open cred does the 
  verification uh portion of it um however before I get oh we'll 
  we'll go over a number of things today like you know what does 
  open Credit do why did we build it how does it work what can you 
  use it for uh things like that but before I get too far I wanted 
  to say a huge thank you to a number of ccg uh community members 
  um they're the ones that built uh the platform I'm just here kind 
  of talking about it um so many of you know uh them so Nate Otto I 
  think who is here today uh Brian uh coyote uh Ganesh Dave Longley 
  Matt uh Dave Lane um uh did an enormous amount of work.
Manu Sporny:  On the platform to get it to uh where it is uh 
  today so thank you thank you thank you uh very much.
Manu Sporny:   To all of them.
Manu Sporny:  Uh I don't know Neil if that's a hand to speak or 
  is it clapping hand.
Manu Sporny:  I'm going to keep going um okay so thank you very 
  much to the open Credit uh devs um for putting the system 
  together um they continue to work on it if you have any questions 
  there there a great source of information um.
Manu Sporny:  So what is this thing um.
<anil_john_[us/dhs/svip]> Sorry.. butter fingered the clapping 
  hands :-)
Manu Sporny:  Fundamentally um as I mentioned it is a uh 
  verifiable credential verifier uh it is open source so you can go 
  to uh the California DMV GitHub repository or the state of 
  California GitHub repository and download the Open Crow cred 
  platform um it was funded by partially funded by the California 
  DMV um and basically it's just it's something that helps you 
  check.
Manu Sporny:  People's verifiable credentials like that's that's 
  what it does um uh it is in production so it is running in 
  production today for State of California there are a number of 
  other entities that are deploying it into production uh and it 
  supports multiple formats uh and protocols you can read more 
  about it uh on the California uh website there's the URL in the 
  slide deck uh that you can take a look at uh there.
Manu Sporny:  Um why is this a big deal um well um.
<kerri_lemoie> Having trouble with the url
<harrison_tang> which URL?
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Manu Sporny:  Uh okay so that's kind of from an architectural 
  perspective where you where you can put open cred and and make it 
  work um uh.
<kerri_lemoie> Earlier slide: 
  https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/opencred-for-developers/
Manu Sporny:  Also can provide uh user interface as I mentioned 
  um this is from the California DMV website so like I mentioned 
  this is in production for California um.
<harrison_tang> i see.  that link doesn't work for me as well
<pl/t3> Yup - same problem here with the CA DMV link Kerri just 
  shared.
Manu Sporny:  They put it on their login screen so 1 of the use 
  cases that California has is like just log in using your driver's 
  license uh because California DMV basically has your driver's 
  license data already and it's associated with an account and 
  there's a whole bunch of kind of Virtual Field office stuff that 
  California is doing and they want people to go beyond just 
  username and password to log in they want kind of a strong 
  authentication um through their app so 1 of the ways is to log in 
  with the California DMV app as an option if you click that um it 
  will generate on the California DMV website on the left here it 
  will generate a QR code and then you use on the right here as a 
  screenshot of someone using their phone to scan the QR code and 
  that will put you into an oid for VP um exchange running over VC 
  API um.
<kerri_lemoie> I think I got it right....?
<nate_otto> @Kerri interesting, I'll report that to the DMV team, 
  that is the correct URL.
<kerri_lemoie> Thanks
Manu Sporny:  And then and then you know it's standard stuff 
  happens with the digital wallet digital wallet says do you want 
  to share this information you decide whether or not you want to 
  share it um and then uh you put that uh and then it sends the 
  data to open cred which then uh checks the digital signature 
  checks the certificate chain uh make sure that the verifiable 
  credential is valid uh all that kind of stuff does all these 
  checks and then if all the checks you know come out that it's a 
  valid uh uh driver's license it will then send it back over to 
  the originating website like the login website um and then you 
  log in like that that's that's the like kind of the simplest uh 
  uh use case um uh.
Manu Sporny:  That's it I mean it's it's pretty I mean you know 
  it's a I'm sure everyone's seen the the flows before it's like 
  pretty straightforward it shows a QR code you scan it on your 
  phone you hit yes and then you're logged in that's that's that's 
  the end of it um.
Manu Sporny:  The uh like I mentioned there are 2 operational 
  modes that it can run in uh 1 of them is it can operate as an 
  open ID connect provider um and that is if your organization 
  already uses open ID uh you know connect to to do the log in it 
  can act as a provider and give you back a tokens uh to a to a 
  website um or it's got an HTTP API and that's if you're not 
  running uh open ID uh to do log in uh and you have a website 
  where you want to be more in control of the login experience 
  there are a bunch of apis that you can call to like.
Manu Sporny:  Create the the workflow like the the oid for VP uh 
  you know exchange um get the information from The Exchange check 
  to see if the uh the individual has uh finished the exchange um 
  uh there's a whole bunch of kind of like what's the current 
  status of the exchange uh tell me if you got you know the 
  information and then finally there's an a API call to actually 
  get the the driver's license data that you want you know out of 
  the uh The Exchange um and that's generalized meaning like it's 
  any verifiable credential that was handed over uh you can get the 
  the the verified information back without having to do all the 
  crypto and did resolution and and all that kind of stuff um.
<pl/t3> and that URL for github works!
Manu Sporny:  Is for uh the GitHub repo so it's it's open source 
  you can go there uh you can download the source you can run it 
  we've already got multiple fairly large organizations that are 
  starting to use this um uh you can raise issues um you know we'll 
  we'll respond when we can um.
Manu Sporny:  And that's it that's that's where the that's where 
  the GitHub repo is um there are a number of features uh as well 
  but before I start going into the features let's stop for a 
  second any questions on.
Manu Sporny:   What I.
Manu Sporny:  Spoken to uh so far um around like vision and what 
  we're trying to accomplish here.
Manu Sporny:  Okay if not I'll go ahead and go into the feature 
  set um so there are a number of features that open Credit has uh 
  that are worth kind of speaking to the the first thing is it's a 
  docker-based deployment which basically means you can you can 
  deploy it to any Cloud environment it can be on premise uh it can 
  be a hybrid Cloud environment it can be a pure Cloud environment 
  such as AWS uh gcp Microsoft Azure it's totally agnostic to where 
  it's deployed in how it's run um since you have access to the 
  source code you know you can make modifications to it if you want 
  to um but but that's the general way that that we expect it to be 
  deployed is is you know through Docker um.
Manu Sporny:  Because it's a Docker image and because we've uh 
  written it to be um uh fairly um stateless uh you can 
  horizontally scale to tens of millions of verifications per day 
  so you know this is out in production uh it can scale to tens of 
  millions of verifications per day and you can go even higher than 
  that if you horizontally scale it um that's up to your it team to 
  figure out you know how to do that Best Inn in your 
  infrastructure but uh it's built to do that so it's not it's not 
  a toy it's not you know it's not limited um for small use cases 
  um as I mentioned it's the.
Manu Sporny:   The same.
Manu Sporny:  Name code that's on the.
Manu Sporny:  Uh on the GitHub repo is the same code that we're 
  running for California DMV in production for everyone in in 
  California.
Manu Sporny:   It does.
Manu Sporny:  Does support internationalization for multiple 
  languages so a number of the screens that you saw uh like this 
  thing on the left here that that is generated through um open 
  credit that is in open Credit uh screen and each 1 of these um 
  you know pieces of text can be replaced can be internationalized 
  uh you'll see the translations thing up at the top here uh any 
  language you want you can translate the the text to um and it's 
  not just this text you can totally change each line of this text 
  as well so it's very configurable based on the instructions you 
  want to give to.
Manu Sporny:   You know.
Manu Sporny:  Population of people that are using the system.
Manu Sporny:  It's got internationalization support just uh built 
  in um.
Manu Sporny:  In this next 1 is pretty interesting it can also um 
  do auditing um this is a feature that large organizations tend to 
  want um where uh it will cache did documents um that were used to 
  do login and verification where you can um send the presentation 
  you can you can in in open cred does not do this it does not 
  store presentations but you can configure other systems to store 
  those presentations and then you can in the future uh if for 
  example an organization needs to prove that somebody did in fact 
  interact with them um to do something that has some kind of 
  regulatory thing associated with it like you know the um the 
  financial reporting or something like that Banks need to prove 
  that uh they actually interacted with you before you did you know 
  a transfer over a certain amount um uh open Credit uh can can.
Manu Sporny:  5 Presentations that happened in the past last 6 
  months last year last 5 years whatever um by ensuring that it 
  keeps uh cash versions of the documents around so even if the did 
  document disappears off the web or uh off of the the DT that it's 
  on uh open credit is capable of saying yeah when the person sent 
  that presentation to a half years ago um it is uh it was valid it 
  was valid then um.
Manu Sporny:   And that.
Manu Sporny:  Organizations meet regulatory burden if they're 
  required to keep that information around um but again to be clear 
  open Credit does not store.
Manu Sporny:  Those presentations um we didn't think that that 
  would be a good General feature for the the platform to have um 
  that is coming out in the next release about the credit so 
  that'll be out in a couple of weeks um so that's kind of a a 
  handful of features that it has it also has a number of other uh 
  features that we covered previously um so it supports open 
  digital wallet selection um uh through multiple mechanisms 1 
  through chappie uh I can use the credential Handler API to do 
  while its selection both web-based apps and uh uh sorry web-based 
  uh digital wallets and Native digital wallets um it uh supports 
  different presentation protocols uh so it can use the chappie 
  native stuff it can use uh verifiable credentials workflows and 
  exchanges through VC API uh and it also supports oid for VP oh it 
  supports all of those things and it's just a configuration 
  setting to be able to support uh variation.
Manu Sporny:   Of those.
Manu Sporny:  Other thing that it has support for is it can do 
  local verifier support meaning like it's natively at can verify 
  credentials itself if it needs to um or there are through the 
  verifiable credential API there are API endpoints that do 
  credential verification and so if you have a more Enterprise 
  grade verification um software deployment out there you can just 
  point to it uh with open cred and it will uh use the external uh 
  verifier system to do it um to do the verification um that is 
  useful for large organizations uh in state federal governments uh 
  big uh companies with you know strong it processes in place uh 
  where they would specify like specifically these are the contexts 
  we support uh these are the did methods we support we don't 
  support anything other than this or.
Manu Sporny:   They have.
Manu Sporny:  That they want to support that are not you know 
  built in natively uh in the open Credit um.
Manu Sporny:  Or they want they need to use external resolvers or 
  or things of that nature so um you can start off kind of native 
  open credit and then you can move into you know other other 
  mechanisms um I'll also note that uh.
Manu Sporny:  Other external verifier support that we have is 
  we've got Microsoft entra support built in uh to open Credit as 
  well so if you're running on Microsoft entra uh you can hook it 
  up to your Microsoft entry instance and uh do uh verification uh 
  through that as well um so you can either either use the 
  verifiable credential API which is you know uh a pretty standard 
  uh but an open kind of specification or you can use the 
  proprietary Microsoft entra uh API to do uh verification um so in 
  a nutshell those are kind of the features that that uh open 
  Credit uh has um and that's pretty much it that's that's all I 
  you know was going to cover today um.
Manu Sporny:   We can.
Manu Sporny:  2 Questions if folks have any um happy to try and 
  talk about roadmap happy to talk about like you know um uh what I 
  can with respect to what went well and what didn't go so well 
  with you know implementing this thing uh in in working with the 
  various um standards and pretty standards out there um so let me 
  let me start let me stop there and see if there are any uh 
  questions uh concerns comments.
Kimberly Linson:  No 1 know what to do because you're usually the 
  first person to ask a question.
Kimberly Linson:  Will go ahead.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah um happy to cover some of that um and I might 
  you know um uh Nate feel free to jump in with with other issues 
  that that you saw um while we were implementing I'll note that 
  you know we are trying to support every digital credential I mean 
  the major digital credential formats and and the major protocols 
  here and um.
Manu Sporny:  1 Of the challenges that we had was trying to hit a 
  Target on what to implement um uh things that shifted out from 
  under us while we were implementing where things like oid for VP 
  um we've implemented something that you know is is I forget which 
  version we ended up implementing but it's already changed right 
  the new specs are already already different from it and now 
  there's a question of like all right like how are we going to 
  support the old thing now and we didn't even implement the the 
  middle thing and now there's a new thing as of 2 weeks ago uh so 
  how do we keep Pace with that um.
Manu Sporny:  The the selection of VC jot 1 1 was.
Manu Sporny:  All we had at the time um and it is I would imagine 
  it's not ideal um you know we we would have preferred that a 
  different decision was made but you know.
Manu Sporny:  When large organizations look at this stuff they're 
  looking for things that are fairly stable that are that are you 
  know not going to change NBC j11 was kind of locked in stone so 
  that's kind of the the approach we took um.
Manu Sporny:  There was also quite a bit of kind of you know um 
  trying to align the way mdl and the VC JWT digital driver's 
  license was done that led to I mean we you know we used did jwk 
  um and that led to its own set of like.
Manu Sporny:   Kind of.
<stephan_baur> Is there a schema def for the mDL in form of 
  VC-JWT?
Manu Sporny:  Weird things that happened during uh implementation 
  like for example like when we were starting to you know uh uh 
  move these VC jots around and all that kind of stuff we started 
  hitting storage limitations and databases um because because 
  their legacy systems that we were integrating with and they were 
  like you know who who would even think of storing something over 
  250 kilobytes for every presentation but you know that's kind of 
  like where we ended up so so there and and there's like X5 or 9 
  certificates chain stuff that ended up being pulled in with did 
  jwk that required us to implement an entire uh certificate chain 
  you know uh uh uh uh checking uh you know mechanism which which 
  is implemented kind of I mean it is implemented um but 
  integrating it in with everything else it took time and it was 
  kind of a pain and you know we got it wrong a number of times uh 
  before we got it right um and even that is you know kind of.
Manu Sporny:   The shifting.
Manu Sporny:  The biggest challenge here were um.
Manu Sporny:  Something into production uh with the shifting 
  Sands around the oid 4 stuff and um uh in kind of.
Manu Sporny:  Not I wouldn't say experimental usage of did jwk 
  but definitely you know it was more Theory than practice when we 
  were implementing it and so we had to make a number of kind of 
  design decisions on on what we were putting out there uh now all 
  that to say what we have out there is stable um but it's old and 
  it is definitely not what's going to be the the thing that you 
  know ends up being standardized uh but but you know sorry the 
  thing that ends up being what you know the vc20 work you know 
  ends up becoming but um.
Manu Sporny:  Given all that you know it is out in production and 
  it is stable um and we are able to build you know business cases 
  on top of it um and and we were able to kind of uh abstract away 
  the implementation details to the point where the the thing that 
  you get at the end which is the verified verifiable credential uh 
  you could write your business logic just to work on that so you 
  operate on the verifiable credential uh data model layer you 
  don't operate on the the did layer or the the protocol layer or 
  the the JWT layer or any of that stuff you just get raw data back 
  that's been verified and you kind of work off of that so um.
Manu Sporny:   That would.
Manu Sporny:  I would say our high-level.
Manu Sporny:  Experience with trying to put this thing together 
  and and get it out there into production I see Nate's on the 
  Queue so please over to you Nate.
Nate Otto:  Yeah thanks for that summary the 1 additional 
  challenge that I wanted to kind of bring in was.
Nate Otto:  Some tension between use cases where the wallet is 
  known we know exactly which wallet our population is going to use 
  and use cases where we want to enable their to be wallet Choice 
  it's kind of hard in a user experience um in a web app like this 
  to do both of those things at the same time um and so the the app 
  here attempts to kind of thread the the needle between.
Nate Otto:  These 2 different use cases because different 
  customers will want to either allow wallet selection and to be 
  very um agile as to which protocol the um exchange is going to 
  operate over and then other um users may have a use case where 
  they've got a very specific wallet um that they expect users to 
  to use in a very specific protocol that that supports and it's 
  just kind of hard to build an an interface at the at this point 
  in ecosystem that can do all of these different um things at the 
  same time and and in a way that makes sense to the user who 
  really should not ever need to know what a chappie is or or what 
  a VC API is um but I think this is an interesting um stab at 
  attempting to solve that problem and I think we did a pretty good 
  job especially with a lot of the um customizability of all of the 
  text strings in the interface uh and so we're looking forward to 
  seeing other approaches out there and um the evolution of these 
  different standards to work together a little.
Nate Otto:   Bit better.
Nate Otto:  So that hopefully.
Nate Otto:  We can put together a really nice um user experience 
  that enables um either wallet choice or uh kind of a guided 
  selection to hard a particular um wallet as different users need.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's yeah absolutely uh Nate uh and I I 
  think what what ended up happening is is at least with open 
  Credit like if you look at the config format it is massively uh 
  like configurable to the point where I think we we probably all 
  believe there's just like there's enough configurability to get 
  yourself in trouble um and that you know I think we we probably 
  are going to try to try to figure out ways to make it easier to 
  to reason through the ways you can configure this stuff so it's 
  massively flexible right now but now you have to kind of like 
  understand how like.
Manu Sporny:  For Stuff where all the oid stuff works all the VC 
  stuff works VC API chappie all that kind of stuff to to figure 
  out you know what subset of that you're going to use um certainly 
  you know people in this community can guide people in in setting 
  it up but it's certainly not like you know TurnKey software uh at 
  at this point um Nate I don't know if you want to speak to like 
  we also had issues with like a deep Link versus uh you know um 
  protocol scheme Handler versus like QR code um.
Manu Sporny:  Do you like to elaborate on kind of some of the 
  challenges there.
Nate Otto:  Yeah uh so as we're learning um some of these 
  protocols work really well for same device flows or really well 
  for crust device flows and sometimes.
Nate Otto:  A particular protocol doesn't work very well for both 
  a cross device flow and the same device flow at the same time and 
  so for example The Experience around scanning a QR code you you 
  can't scan a QR code with a camera on the back of the device that 
  where the screen is on the front of the device showing the QR 
  code so we have to turn that into some kind of Link uh for that 
  same device use case and um the multiple different options there 
  are to use a particular um URL scheme like the open ID for VP 
  scheme um that is clickable here if you tap the QR code or in a 
  newer version of the interface there's a there's a button uh that 
  you can click or it auto detects that you're on a mobile device 
  expects that you won't need to scan a QR code now it's a button 
  you can click but it's really just a link to an open ID for VP uh 
  scheme and if your device has a Handler for that scheme installed 
  cool if it has exactly 1 Handler installed great now you've 
  opened it in that app.
Nate Otto:   If you.
Nate Otto:  There's multiple different wallet um devices that 
  purport to handle that scheme then the selection experience as to 
  which 1 open can be a little bit unpredictable.
Nate Otto:  Another option is to use a deep link um.
Nate Otto:  Which is an HTTP link but it goes to a particular 
  domain on a you know that is owned by a certain developer that 
  has registered that domain to associate with a certain app that 
  they control and so there's you can see that there's some 
  trade-offs using these different mechanisms if you use a um 
  custom URL scheme then there might be multiple apps on the phone 
  experience might be tricky picking which 1 and if you use a deep 
  link then there is only 1 app that the user could navigate to 
  with that link so they would need to kind of Select which wallet 
  they're using before the link is even generated for them and.
Nate Otto:  And then alternately to that there's the whole choppy 
  flows which um.
Nate Otto:  Kind of a different set of trade-offs um we're also 
  encountering some issues around um custom link handlers inside 
  web views so if you render the open cred UI inside a web view 
  sometimes when the user clicks that link it results in an error 
  and that needs to be caught and then retriggered rather than the 
  system being able to just pick up on that link click and navigate 
  it to to the direct um application.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah yeah absolutely so so as you know everyone 
  heard like there are lots of challenges on all the different ways 
  that you can invoke and um you know go through these flows.
Manu Sporny:  Um they're just made really complicated with the 
  different decisions platform vendors have made um in theory you 
  know digital credential API is going to save all of us and it's 
  going to get it right right for both cross devices and same 
  device and it'll be this wonderful um uh you know Utopia once 
  once we get there but uh this is the reality of it today um that 
  said like it's usable like we've you know people are using it um 
  uh and so there are ways to get through this and the open Credit 
  system tries to iron over all of those wrinkles that Nate was 
  talking about but again it's not necessarily Just Like You Know 
  download the software run it and off you go you've got a you've 
  got a try all the variations out uh to make sure it works for 
  your um use case.
Manu Sporny:  Any other questions coyote I don't know if you 
  wanted to add anything with respect to like um things that were 
  hard to implement or um.
Manu Sporny:  Challenges we we face that we haven't met or 
  haven't mentioned yet.
Kayode Ezike:  Yeah I think I think you guys covered on the 
  general high level stuff um.
Kayode Ezike:  I think there was some stuff with auditing as well 
  that came that came about um around actually tracking like.
Kayode Ezike:  You know the tokens that were presented in the 
  past and you know understanding that there's you know differences 
  in different.
Kayode Ezike:  Did did types go through a dynamic we retrieved 
  from uh appetite web or those that are static and handling those 
  differently um as far as.
Kayode Ezike:  Um the different versions of those dates I know 
  that there's work being done.
Kayode Ezike:  Did spec where you can actually start to specify 
  the different versions and expose an API for that but um and also 
  I mean y'all may be familiar with Brian's work with TDW is did TW 
  as well which kind of tries to address that as well um but each 
  of those things are kind of relatively n n so.
Kayode Ezike:  That's all I have.
Kaliya Young:  So the code for this is currently in the 
  California DMV repo.
Kaliya Young:  Um as refunded by them is this it the permanent 
  home for the code or.
Kaliya Young:   Will the.
Kaliya Young:  Code be somewhere else um.
Kaliya Young:  And partly I'm asking because um.
Kaliya Young:  You know there's.
Kaliya Young:  There can be confusion about.
Kaliya Young:  Fusion in the market about.
Kaliya Young:  What things do and who you know like there's just 
  how do we get clear about.
Kaliya Young:  Some of these things and maybe you know but maybe 
  answer the first question and then I can ask a more particular 
  version of second question.
Kaliya Young:  Oh sorry okay.
Nate Otto: https://github.com/stateofca/opencred\
Manu Sporny:  Sure yeah I mean I I get I I get the question the 
  second question you're asking so um uh mechanically the code is 
  in the state of California GitHub repo not the California DMV 
  doesn't have a direct repo so it's state of CA um I mean yeah I 
  mean and it's like super easy to to I was I was like why why I 
  was like I don't understand why that's happening where why aren't 
  we putting it in the DMV repo so right now it's state of CA 
  slopen credit what you see on the the screen um it will remain 
  there for as long as the the state of California.
Manu Sporny:  You know decides um.
Manu Sporny:  I can't speak to what's the future plans there are 
  I can probably say that like they would like to make sure that 
  the system that they are deploying uh in production is uh you 
  know at least under their control if it were moved somewhere else 
  I would expect them to maintain a fork um that would pull in uh 
  Upstream um uh so so if you you know who's in charge of you know 
  open credit right now it's the it's the California DMV primarily 
  in the state of California.
Manu Sporny:  That it is open source and so anybody can Fork it 
  so if you don't like that you know Fork it and work on it you 
  know elsewhere it's under an open source license so that you can 
  do that um I'll also mention that the the base I said partially 
  funded by uh because the base of open credit is all of um the 
  digital Bazaar open source libraries so there's a set of uh just 
  fundamental like node.js libraries that build up uh an 
  application kind of layer uh that uh again is under an open 
  source license a digital Bazaar and then we added a bunch of 
  other things on top of that uh to build open Credit um but since 
  all of it is under an open source license then you know anybody 
  can Fork any 1 of uh the top level package or all the bottom 
  level packages and.
Manu Sporny:   Uh do.
Manu Sporny:  On to as long as it follows the open source license 
  that it's under um if I remember correctly uh I think it was 
  Apache 2 that we ended up uh licensing it under.
Manu Sporny:  Yes Benjamin uh who was involved in the licensing 
  of it yeah so it's Apache 2 um.
Manu Sporny:  Does that answer your question Kia I don't know if 
  it answered the second question.
Kaliya Young:  Yeah that was super helpful um a follow-up um is 
  um.
Kaliya Young:  Maybe it's a I haven't really poked around enough 
  but like.
Kaliya Young:  You know which standards are you using and is that 
  like is there a list somewhere and is there anything in this that 
  isn't standards based or like.
<benjamin_young> Actually...It's BSD-3-Clause. Apologies! 
  https://github.com/stateofca/opencred
Kaliya Young:  Like where's the line between like we we you know 
  we had to go production so we fill the hole versus like the 
  following the standards.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah that's a great question that probably I I 
  don't think the readme has the list of standards that we 
  Implement does it Nate Benjamin I don't think it does.
Manu Sporny:  Okay we should we should definitely list them 
  because that would be a good thing to have there the the goal 
  Kalia is was everything's meant to be standards based we tried to 
  not fill any holes with any kind of like made up made up you know 
  proprietary thing um so uh we Implement you know oid for VP which 
  which version do do we ever forget which 1 we ended up 
  implementing um.
Nate Otto:  A little bit unclear I don't necessarily think the 
  wallets we were testing with.
Nate Otto:   Were compatible.
Nate Otto:  A specific version either but we're really close to 
  the latest version which is I think 20.
Manu Sporny:  Yeah yeah yeah so so yeah we started with 18 and 
  things weren't working and then we did 20 but but again like the 
  wallets didn't necessarily implement the and then of course 
  there's a new version as of 2 weeks ago of id4 um that we are 
  definitely not uh aligned with um VC API we follow uh the latest 
  uh in the specifications verifiable credential 1 1 we follow the 
  spec to the T as far as we know same thing for V jot 1 1 um uh 
  there's the VC API backend stuff for issuance verification uh 
  sorry for issuance sorry for verification uh that we follow I 
  don't think we currently implement the did resolution spec 
  because we don't.
Manu Sporny:  Integrate with an external resolver um did Webb did 
  did uh key um did jwk um.
Manu Sporny:  Number of pre-and here that we did our best to try 
  and align with whatever was in the specification so um.
Manu Sporny:   I'm trying.
Manu Sporny:  Think if if if there's anything where we went kind 
  of.
Manu Sporny:  There was something that was so new that we were 
  like oh that's not being worked on anywhere we're just going to 
  have to slap something together um.
Manu Sporny:  Ing stuff might be the closest to it but oh sorry.
Kimberly Linson:  And I want to let I want to let Stephen we're 
  just about at time and I want to let Stephen asked his his 
  question.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah thank you thanks man for presenting this and 
  setting the deck ahead and all that and thanks for the team uh 2 
  2 things 1 is in in relation to before with the standards uh can 
  you also really specify the the software supply chain for it 
  like.
Stephan_Baur: You know the the the polyfill sort of issues just 
  kind of showed again that that importance that would be equally 
  helpful to have that.
Stephan_Baur: Um and then the question I had and I had this also 
  on the issue list um of course is the next thing around issuance 
  is there any plans on the road map for issuance.
Manu Sporny:  Um I'll try to answer the second question first um 
  there are airplanes to hook up to external issuance 
  infrastructures um we the the the doing kind of a lightweight you 
  know open source implementation of an issuer um we don't feel 
  comfortable doing that right now primarily because like we've we 
  do.
Manu Sporny:   Set up issues.
Manu Sporny:  Organizations and it takes a lot of effort to make 
  sure that you've got something that's maintainable over the long 
  term uh and so we we are going to use VC API to hook into 
  external issuance infrastructures um to start um as far as 
  software supply chain um you know the package.js available there 
  you did bring up a good point about like chappie and dependence 
  on external resources um because it's you know it's open source 
  and it's configurable you don't have to use the components that 
  you don't want to right and so you can deactivate you know those 
  components if if that's what you want to do I don't know I don't 
  we haven't really talked that much about kind of.
Manu Sporny:  Supply chain for you know this this piece of 
  software it's like most other open source software it's kind of 
  like.
Manu Sporny:  You get what you you get that what's there and then 
  if you want to do anything else software supply chain on top of 
  it it's kind of up to you as the deployer to to do that um that 
  Benjamin sorry go ahead.
Benjamin Young:  Yeah I just wanted to add to that we um I said 
  the wrong license earlier it's BSD 3 Clause um but we did do some 
  uh extra lifting at the beginning.
Benjamin Young:  To implement the ReUse um specification that 
  does make generating uh software Bill and materials uh relatively 
  trivial um California isn't publishing any yet but.
Benjamin Young:  Can through the GitHub settings among other 
  places.
Stephan_Baur: Great thank you very helpful.
Kimberly Linson:  Great thank you all thank you Manu this is 
  again really exciting exciting work and and exciting to see this 
  all sort of.
Kimberly Linson:  Starting the the flywheel starting to really 
  turn uh and.
<benjamin_young> REUSE https://reuse.software/
Kimberly Linson:  That is it for today we've gone over just a 
  little bit so I appreciate everyone's patience thank you for this 
  great conversation and we look forward to seeing you next week.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-127').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-127').show()" id="127" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  These 2 different use cases because different customers will want to either allow wallet selection and to be very um agile as to which protocol the um exchange is going to operate over and then other um users may have a use case where they&apos;ve got a very specific wallet um that they expect users to to use in a very specific protocol that that supports and it&apos;s just kind of hard to build an an interface at the at this point in ecosystem that can do all of these different um things at the same time and and in a way that makes sense to the user who really should not ever need to know what a chappie is or or what a VC API is um but I think this is an interesting um stab at attempting to solve that problem and I think we did a pretty good job especially with a lot of the um customizability of all of the text strings in the interface uh and so we&apos;re looking forward to seeing other approaches out there and um the evolution of these different standards to work together a little. <a id="link-127" style="display:none;" href="#127">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-135').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-135').show()" id="135" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  A particular protocol doesn&apos;t work very well for both a cross device flow and the same device flow at the same time and so for example The Experience around scanning a QR code you you can&apos;t scan a QR code with a camera on the back of the device that where the screen is on the front of the device showing the QR code so we have to turn that into some kind of Link uh for that same device use case and um the multiple different options there are to use a particular um URL scheme like the open ID for VP scheme um that is clickable here if you tap the QR code or in a newer version of the interface there&apos;s a there&apos;s a button uh that you can click or it auto detects that you&apos;re on a mobile device expects that you won&apos;t need to scan a QR code now it&apos;s a button you can click but it&apos;s really just a link to an open ID for VP uh scheme and if your device has a Handler for that scheme installed cool if it has exactly 1 Handler installed great now you&apos;ve opened it in that app. <a id="link-135" style="display:none;" href="#135">✪</a></div>

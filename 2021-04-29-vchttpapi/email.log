<orie> /me just ...
Manu Sporny: Welcoming attendees
  ... IPR disclaimer for non-CCG members
Manu Sporny: Today's agenda is Daniel Hardman's presentation from 
  the list 
  https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Apr/0193.html 
  and proposals for this work item
Manu Sporny:  HTTP APIs for CredX as mailed to list

Topic: GNAP and Relationship to VC HTTP API

Justin Richer:  IADF Draft protocol, openID 0Auth proposal
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/gnap/documents/
Justin Richer: Gnap: 
  https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-05.html
Justin Richer:  GNAP new work in IATF
<orie> I would say GNAP is a great fit for holder interactions, 
  but does not match map cleanly to "issuer" or "verifier" 
  functionality in the current vc http api... though I could see 
  the whole thing getting replaced by GNAP with enough effort.
  ... expanding user inteaction possibilities, no longer assuming 
  user is in browser
  ... good fit with GNAP? signifcant overlap seen
  ... intention to attend further meetings if possible. IATF 
  meeting next week, open invitation to channel to attend
  ... newest GNAP spec, attention to section 4
<mike_varley> GNAP is a re-engineering of patterns in OAuth and 
  OIDC to enable dynamic and flexible user-to-server interactions 
  and authorizations (enabling bring your own wallet and mobile 
  interactions etc...) and overlaps on some of the objectives of 
  this HTTP API in a broader sense (but focused on authorization)
  ...so we really want to know, does the API fit as an extension 
  of the protocol, and if so, how, what changes are needed etc. 
  Call for feedback, suggestions. we encourage as many people as 
  possible to track both conversations and keep them in line.

Topic: HTTP APIs for CredX

Daniel Buchner:  HTTP APIs for Credential exchange 
  ... dovetailing with GNAP dsiscussed previously
  ... Issue 50 on VC HTTP API
  ... use cases under discussion include Didcomm, Daniel wrote a 
  Medium article about this
  ... framing credential exchange as HTTP problem is a false 
  approach, and I would rather we expand the use cases beyond ones 
  where HTTP is a bottleneck
<heathervescent> LOL
  ... Korean use case using verifiable credentials to monitor 
  clocking in/out
  ... Mobile device connecting to webserver to authenticate, 
  concentration of operations in narrow time windows
  ... this lead to a suggestion of having to massively scale 
  server capabilities, prompting rethink of the authentication 
  infrastructure
<juan_caballero> wow direct NFC proofing
Orie Steele: +1 To direct p2p support without the need for an 
  http mediator.
Orie Steele: :)
  ... using NFC would allow us to avoid server connections 
  altogether, making perfect horizontal scaleability if it can be 
  enabled.
  ... use case #2, the Uber example, taxi driver wisdom
Orie Steele: 
  https://github.com/transmute-industries/cbor-ld-web-transports 
  (NFC and QR Code transports for VPs / VCs)
Mike Prorock: +1 To looking at schemas and structures in multiple 
  formats and not limiting to http only
  ... plot twist: Uber driver has covid-19
<juan_caballero> (asking uber drivers for their medical records 
  is not currently legal or ethical)
  ... idea = ordinary people as verifiers, horizontal 
  verifications
<juan_caballero> (but maybe "prove you work for uber" or "prove 
  you can legally drive a car" would be simpler examples of the 
  same use cases sidestepping health record privacy and ethics)
  ... using verifiable identity to negotiate personal exchanges, 
  reciprocity, not such a good fit with HTTP approaches
  ... use case 3 Italian Visa
  ... Delayed responses due to time difference, human processes
  ... HTTP API could be a possible solution, but the Swiss 
  government has no such infrastructure
Orie Steele: Most folks don't run webservers on their phone 
  voluntarily :)
  ... Swiss gov could sidestep HTTP to solve the issue
  ... use case 4
  ... digital cash -  FB Libra concerns triggered wave of 
  interest in CBDCs
  ... current global government projects investigating digital 
  cash infrastructure, esp offline solutions
  ... Bahamas mention, Sand Dollar, designed to distribute 
  disaster aid relief, to remove internet connection requirement
  ... VCs for KYC & AML
  ... Gov requirements indicate that HTTP is not applicable in 
  all cases, they need to be more generic and high level
  ... Specificites of HTTP will keep edge cases like these on the 
  margins, sucking up all the oxygen, funding, and momentum for 
  institutional cases relying on client/server architectures
<tallted> big +1000
  ... I want us to broaden the design spec, describe something 
  HTTP specific as one implementation but not the only one
  ... describe problems as "payloads" without fixing everything 
  to web-based implementation details
<orie> in a world where vc-http-api is just a single endpoint for 
  receiving post messages.
  ... i also think we need to keep the issue of transport 
  security separate, so that different implementations and use 
  cases can apply security above or below this layer rather than 
  having one security model fixed by assumptions we make now
  ... 3 alternative paths for standardization
<juan_caballero> red is plan A, yellow and green are two 
  acceptable plans B?
<orie> Thanks Daniel!
<mprorock> thank you!
<evan_tedesco> I think green is plan a
  ... existing transport security - new standard, existing  
  transport security - coalescing stnadard for credx
  ... standard for transport-agnostic encryption envelope
Manu Sporny:  We don't want to pitch HTTP as the only solution
  ... can we look at the issue wholistically instead of narrowing 
  the approach
Justin Richer:  I understand the desire for a broader more 
  abstracted system that is more widely applicable, but I hold it 
  to be a fiction. The last time we tried for a giant abstract 
  system was SOAP
Orie Steele: I happen to have liked working with SOAP : .
  ... SOAP was a platform-agnostic solution
<juan_caballero> ^Some of my best friends are SOAP
<anil_john> Me too! WSDLs, Schemas' Oh My!
<mprorock> sshhhh orie, don't tell people that (seriously, why 
  would you want type safety and tooling)
  ... these don't take advantage of any native aspects of the 
  tech being used, writing to an assume common abstraction layer
<dlongley> +1000 to Justin
  ... building an abstraction layer on top of HTTP that 
  eventually rely on quirks or structure of the underlying tech, 
  even if unintentional
  ... note, this is not a request for niche counter-examples
<tobias_looker> Yeap +1 to justin
  ...´one appraoch that has been seen to work is to take the 
  concepts from a concrete system which depends on a specific set 
  of transpot, security layers etc and translating it, eg. TLS 
  moving to somehting TLS-like, abstraction not being a 
  one-size-fits-all solution
<justin_r> apologies for being longwinded, this is something that 
  I have cared about and talked about a LOT in my career....
Markus Sabadello:  Ongoing discussion at VC HTTP 
Orie Steele:  I'm sorry that you have stockholm syndrome from 
  SOAP [scribe assist by Justin Richer]
  ... Referring back to issue 50, question of scope, internal vs 
  external
Justin Richer:  In fairness I only used SOAP over HTTP :) [scribe 
  assist by Orie Steele]
Daniel Buchner:  HTTP is ideal for an internal insfrastructure, 
  but there is little pressure to standardize there. I am not even 
  certain the distinction holds very well.
Orie Steele:  That's exactly my point! That's all anyone ever 
  did! All the abstraction was smoke and mirrors. [scribe assist by 
  Justin Richer]
  ... abstraction would enable multiple platforms like bluetooth, 
  and I think we need to be wary of sacrificing privacy of 
  individuals for the conveneince of organizations by favoring 
  their architectures in our design process
Mike Schwartz:  Internal use case, thinking about the data 
  structures rather than the protocol, eg GRPC
<orie> there is also DIDComm over grpc
<mprorock> @orie yes, didcomm keeps looking better and better to 
  me
Orie Steele: https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2
Dmitri Zagidulin:  +1 To Daniels points, also Justin, going too 
  far with an abstract approach has been unsuccessful in the past 
  but let's not assume things liek  QR code and bluetooth 
  approaches cannot work
  ... more of a 'design stance'
Orie Steele: All didcomm needs is an abstract data model :)
<orie> /jk
Dave Longley:  There are a variety of protocols available, 
  constant uphill battle if we move too far from HTTP approaches, 
  these edge cases may only get addressed if the whole idea moves 
  forwad on an HTTP approach
Orie Steele:  Only if it has deterministic normative translation 
  rules ;) [scribe assist by Justin Richer]
  ... if these use cases are important then they will be adressed 
  in time
Justin Richer:  We can use CDDL! [scribe assist by Orie Steele]
Orie Steele:  Fine w/me [scribe assist by Justin Richer]
Ted O'Connor:  This is a recurring argument
Justin Richer: -1 To TallTed, this isn't what I was saying at all 
  🤷‍♀️
  ... significant achievements have been made, the generic design 
  does not need to be a single abstraction layer to fit all use 
  cases
  ...HTTP and other protocols can play nice, it would be overly 
  simple to narrow the choice to only HTTP
Daniel Buchner: Arguing for two abstractions, security and 
  transport
  ... payloads also need to be addressed as an individual problem
  ... concrete use cases have been given as examples
<orie> part of why the universal wallet interop spec calls 
  "issue" / "present" abstract is specifically to allow for 
  optimization at the transport / protocol layer.
  ... SSI has a goal of helping people who are disenfranchised
Juan Caballero: +1
Mike Prorock: +1 Daniel - we are seeing this with vaccination 
  credentials right now
Phil Long: +1 Daniel
<juan_caballero> i see both sides, hopefully there's a middle 
  ground
<juan_caballero> +100 chris is a CHAMP
  ... these issues should not just be addressed where lucrative 
  on the assumption that the way they are being address will 
  automatically benefit fringe cases collaterally
<orie> I can attest that crying doesn't to nearly as much as you 
  might wish it did.

Topic: Use Case Updates

Manu Sporny: 
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-u0_Ub6feiX6DH3jXFJFjt6n3CwKGpkmC3VISqDkWL4/edit#
Manu Sporny:  Juan can you update us on use case news?
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/issues/180
Juan Caballero:  Posted google doc to incorrect repo, oops, now 
  on this repo, 2 volunteers from legendary requirments stepped 
  forward to assist editorially with use-cases and other supporting 
  documentation.
  ... google doc is getting a lot of chatter, happy to move to 
  markdown/respec in the repo instead of gdoc, will wait for the 
  green light from the current editors to move the work over
Manu Sporny:  That may happen in parallel, we don't want to 
  discourage people contributing
  ... task of the editors is to organise after the fact
  ... screen share -  VC HTTP API Use Cases
  ... showing a GH issue template for a use case submission, 
  thanks to Ted for work on this
Heather Vescent: +1 Manu
  ... this will enable a threaded convo about them
  ... presented for your consideration
  ... we probably do need a repo for use cases, feedbakc 
  appreciated on people's ideas for keeping that seperate
<juan_caballero> 3 separate repos or just 3 separate files in the 
  repo to simplify gitflow and merge conflicts?
Heather Vescent:  Likes use case template, question who are 
  providing those use cases
<manu_sporny> Agree, that's the downside -- so perhaps just 
  Google Docs.
  ... Git hub users are people eg familiar with writing 
  documentation
  ... this may be a barrier to entry / self-selecting out useful 
  examples
Justin Richer:  Use cases collected from a number of groups
  ... best used to guide the beginning phases of work rather than 
  shape output
  ... suggestion for wiki structure or similar for managing this 
  collection of data
<charles_edebiri> I agree with Heather. I don't find Github user 
  friendly.
<justin_r> FWIW I disagree with Heather, I don't find Google Docs 
  friendly
  ... as opposed to an issue tracker, important to also ensure 
  people are using the same terms of ref
<heathervescent> ROTFL
<orie> well, as long as the people doing the work can use the 
  tool.
<justin_r> there is no perfect tool, the winning move is to have 
  a dedicated curator that collects them from people "outside" the 
  tool
<orie> like an "editor" ?
<justin_r> it's more important that everything is readable, since 
  writing can be overcome with help

PROPOSAL:  Use the use case template in Juan's Google Doc and 
  Google Docs to collect use cases.

Manu Sporny:  Google doc appears to be working well for now, does 
  anyone object to continuing using that for now, call for 
  submissions from the group if people have objections/concrete 
  suggestions
Juan Caballero: +1
Heather Vescent: +1
Mike Prorock: +1
Manu Sporny: +1
Phil Long: +1
Ted Thibodeau: +1
Markus Sabadello: +1
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: +1
Daniel Hardman: +1
Dmitri Zagidulin: +1
Orie Steele: +1
David Chadwick: +1
Aaron Coburn: +1

RESOLUTION: Use the use case template in Juan's Google Doc and 
  Google Docs to collect use cases.

Manu Sporny:  Google doc is established as primary input 
  mechanism, mailed-in submissions can be added manually
  ... almost got agreeement on VC HTTP API in one respec spec, 
  braking into modular components. Concerns?
  ... issue from last meeting, deferred discussion due to 
  Adrian's absence
Juan Caballero:  3Vs1 issue tied up with if they have delegated 
  responsibility
  ... noted that people have a lot of feeling about holders, this 
  is a big piece of work
Manu Sporny:  Last time we discussed this, the 3 diff specs did 
  not seemt o resonate, maybe we should ask for input now
  ... most popular was the proposal of all in 1 solution
  ... we can also spplit the spec into 3 and ensure that each 3 
  gets a different editor and still pull them into one spec
Manu Sporny: POLL: Create 3 VC HTTP API ReSpec specifications 
  (e.g., Issuing, Verification, Presentation) in addition to the 
  existing OAS file.
Orie Steele: -1
Juan Caballero: -1
Manu Sporny: -1
Dmitri Zagidulin: +1
<dmitriz> er wait
Juan Caballero: So many work items as is :D
<dmitriz> respec..
<tallted> -0.9
Dmitri Zagidulin: +1
Dave Longley: -1
Dmitri Zagidulin: Dammit. I meant -1
Markus Sabadello: -1
Mike Prorock: -1
<juan_caballero> dmitri get it together man
Juan Caballero: :D
Mahmoud Alkhraishi: -1
Phil Long: -1
David Chadwick: +1
  ... Poll do we create 3 differenc respec specs? Does not seem 
  popular
Heather Vescent: -1
<orie> but its not 100% .... does that mean we can't resolve it?
<tobias_looker> if we add dmitrizs votes up -1 +1 -1 there isnt a 
  double vote :)
  ... fairly clear 3 diff spec is an unpopular idea, probly 
  converging on one spec, possibly w 3 diff editors for each 
  section
  ... hopefully Adrian is present next week, proposal will run 
  regardless next week
<orie> I am a fan of file splitting for OAS
<manu> yes, +1 for splitting OAS files
<manu> maybe we just split all of these things into pieces.
Orie Steele: Pleases review: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/pull/178
Markus Sabadello:  Note - if there is support for splitting into 
  3 files, there are likely shared components acress issuing and 
  verifying, is overlap an issue for the editors
<mprorock> Splitting OAS by functinoality, then merging into a 
  master API doc set is a common best practice
Manu Sporny:  Looks like we are moving toward splitting the OAS 
  files
  ... thank you to all attendees for attention and input. Next 
  week discuss use cases and new APIs in the spec
  ... specifically the Holder APIs, please bring use cases for 
  next week to discuss
<orie> can we use daniels use cases?
<orie> for holder interactions
Juan Caballero:  Daniel - slides?
<mprorock> Daniel's use cases are solid
Manu Sporny:  On the mailing list

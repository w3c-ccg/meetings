  … General reminder - please read and comment on this 
  publication from NIST
Adrian Gropper: Zero Trust Architecture 
  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207-draft2.pdf

Topic: Progress on Action Items

Joe Andrieu: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22action%3A+review+next%22
  … since it's likely of interest to the people in this group
  … issue 1 - SIP is not working?
Christopher Allen:  A number of us are having challenges on 
  making SIP work on various platforms
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Dmitri presented the did:web method during 
  last week's VC for Education Task Force meeting. There's a lot of 
  interest in hearing the recording for it (so I backfilled it), 
  and it's available here: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/2020-02-10/
  … it would be great if somebody could write up instructions / 
  tips and tricks
  … looking for volunteers
Joe Andrieu:  Didn't we used to have a blurb, on SIP 
  instructions?
  … if we have one, I'll add a paragraph about Windows
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where would be a good place to put this 
  instruction docs?
Christopher Allen:  On our repo, ultimately. short term, Google 
  Doc is fine
Kim Hamilton Duffy: This: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/connecting.html
Kim Hamilton Duffy:  Please feel free to add / edit this 
  connecting document
Joe Andrieu:  Second issue - Crypto Suite Specifications
  … kimhd? or ChristopherA?
Christopher Allen:  There was a suggestion to close it. But I 
  didn't want Orie's comments on the issue to disappear, if we 
  closed it
  … so we should also add this to our repo's homepage
Joe Andrieu:  Orie just closed this, and put a link to the 
  CryptoSuite Registry
Orie Steele: We should link to the registry, and the registry 
  should link to implementations...
Christopher Allen:  That helps, but I'd also love to have links 
  to various implementations, as well
Orie Steele: In this case it does
  … it would be helpful to point newcomers to the CCG to the spec 
  / implementations
Manu Sporny:  I'd like to highlight that there's a lot of stuff 
  happening with the CryptoSuite stuff, thanks to Orie's efforts
  … as a related announcement to the group: There's a lot of work 
  happening in this space; it's very active
  … we're trying to figure out how the registries work with the 
  DID Core spec
  … so, if you're interested in this, please do track the DID 
  Registry repo
Manu Sporny: 
  https://github.com/w3c/did-core-registry/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed
  … since a lot of activity will be done there
Manu Sporny: https://github.com/w3c/did-core-registry/issues
Joe Andrieu: Q
  … which also relates to this specific issue
Christopher Allen:  The work that's going on in the DID Core 
  Registry is fabulous
  … <garbled>
  … I'd like to see volunteers for managing repos, registries, 
  implementation lists
  … to make this CCG more friendly for newcomers. So, we need an 
  entry point
Orie Steele: I really like the awesome github repo pattern: 
  https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
Orie Steele: For example
Joe Andrieu:  Orie - does the CryptoSuite spec list 
  implementations?
Christopher Allen: Will do
  … agree with Chris, it'd be great to have someone curate a list 
  of implementations
  … so, ACTION item for Chris - raise an issue requesting 
  volunteers / implementation list
Christopher Allen: Closed ok
  … that's it for the front matter. Next up, technical talk
  … on the difference between Capabilities and Credentials
Joe Andrieu: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/meetings/blob/main/2020-02-20/credentials_and_capabilities.pptx
  … before I go into the presentation, I believe we're scheduled 
  next week to have a discussion on Capabilities, Lightning 
  Networks and Macaroons
Christopher Allen:  Yes
  … we have someone who's done an interesting demo using the 
  Lightning Network
  … (it's a payment channel for microcurrency, leveraging 
  Bitcoin)
  … and there's new ability to use macaroons that provide bearer 
  authority (to read content, etc) that can be tied to payment 
  network
  … macaroons being very similar to zCaps
  … there's the ability to make it atomic (the payment gives you 
  the capability)
  … I think this may be relevant to our broader architecture
  … either to the future architecture of zCaps, or in general

Topic: Credentials vc Capabilities

Kim Hamilton Duffy: 
  https://github.com/w3c-ccg/meetings/blob/main/2020-02-18/credentials_and_capabilities.pptx?raw=true
Kim Hamilton Duffy: See my link
Ganesh Annan: The link kimhd worked
Joe Andrieu:  So, both Credentials and Capabilities are digital 
  objects
  … transmittable over any comm channel, and both use 
  cryptography for security assurance
  … used to enhance service, customize features, etc
  … Anyone can make a verifiable statement about anything, on any 
  subject.
  … a traditional use case is - digital credentials (Passports, 
  licenses, etc)
  … But VCs can be issued by anyone. Receipts, wills, business 
  cards, notes to mom, school sick notes for children
  … VCs democratize the ability to produce hard-to-forge 
  credentials
  … The key point to remember - they don't verify the _truth_ of 
  the statement
  … they don't say, for example, 'The Sky is Blue'. Instead, they 
  verify 'Joe says: The Sky is Blue'
  … so, they are statements
  … so, what a verifier does is - go through various checks.
  … do they trust the issuer of the statement?
  … what privileges and services are appropriate for that 
  presenter, based on that statement
  … so, it's the verifier's business logic
  … to see what actions can be taken as a result of VCs
  … What I'm calling Directed Capabilities (previously I referred 
  to them as Digital Capabilities)
  … these are based on 1986 (?)'s Object Capabilities
  … (currently also referred to Authorization Capabilities)
  … there is no clear standard yet. One of the approaches is 
  zCaps, a work item of this CCG,
  … developed by Digital Bazaar,
  … which implements capabilities on top of VCs
  … for those familiar with CHAPI (Credential Handler API) — you 
  can use zCaps through CHAPI, sort of what they were built for
  … so, Directed Capabilities is a generalization of this concept
.. DCs give the ability to perform privileged operations
Manu Sporny: HTTP Signatures spec, which does use ZCAPs (in 
  experiments): 
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-richanna-http-message-signatures-00
Manu Sporny: ZCAP spec - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/
Manu Sporny: All based on object capabilities.
  … the important thing about Directed Capabilities is - they are 
  issued by the same authority that is accepting the credential
  … the process of invoking the capability is what gives an actor 
  the authority to take that action
  … DCs can be set up also to have Delegation, Revocation
  … because these are also digital objects, they can be managed 
  alongside VCs, in digital wallets
  … the idea being that in your wallet you'll have a mix of VCs 
  and DCs
  … so, you'll have credentials, and then capabilities to trigger 
  various actions
  … so, with DCs, the privileges are _explicit_
  … which is a bit of a shift from most ACL-based paradigms
  … the inspection of the capability can directly reveal what is 
  invokable
  … it's easy to audit "what does this let me do"
  … and if the DC is valid, non-revoked, and you invoke it, the 
  contract is that the provider makes the action happen
  … important: these are completely independent of traditional 
  forms of identity (DIDs, etc)
  … so, the atomic manifestation is - the ability to invoke an 
  individual capability
  … so, the DCs are self-contained (not dependent on ambient 
  context)
  … the canonical example of a Directed Capability is a physical 
  car key
  … which is a capability that lets you open and start a car
  … it does not depend on the identity of the user
  … you don't have to register it with a registry, or anything 
  like that
  … so the possession of the key IS the embedded authorization
  … so, for example, in court, if you accuse your child of 
  stealing your car, but you gave them your key, the case won't 
  work — the possession of the key is the authorization
  … so another example of an Attenuated capability is a Valet Key
  … so, it has a subset of permissions of a regular key
  … DCs are Revokable
  … you can revoke / disable the authorization remotely, without 
  tracking down the actual capability
  … and they are Losslessly Delegatable
  … at low marginal cost
  … thirdly, you can Attenuate these capabilities in any number 
  of ways (as allowed by the Issuer)
  … the issuer gets to set up the framework of attenuation 
  privileges, but after that, it's completely under the holder's 
  control
  … so, issuer, when creating a DC, specifies the Scope of the 
  capability
  … and set up the rules fo rrevocation, delegation and 
  attenuation
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Should Capabilities have a type? (ref 
  https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) there's some commonality 
  between this and VCs, and I see why you modeled it differently, 
  but in a few years, will we end up with a range of Verifiable 
  "Things
  … so, if you wanted different actions based on day of the week 
  or time of day, that's possible. But key thing is - the issuer 
  has to support that action
  … but once the issuer sets up the pattern, after that it's 
  entirely under control of the DC holder, operationally
  … all of that supported by cryptography
  … so let's look at an example of a digital car key
  … so now, we can attenuate it in interesting ways. For example, 
  disable trunk access. Or, further, do not allow the car to start. 
  (so, the key can only open the door and that's it)
  … you can have limits on location (so valet can't take car on 
  joyride)
Kim Hamilton Duffy: Meant to link here: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/. there are some elements of 
  VCs that maybe are also needed in zcaps. Joe mentioned issuer...
  … obviously this is limited by car features (like onboard GPS), 
  so you can't arbitrarily make up limitations
  … some architectures require 'phoning home' to the issuer. but 
  other architectures do not
  … So, imagine that a bank gives you a Directed Capability
  … I can delegate them to my accountant, bookkeeper, controller, 
  and so on. So they can have access to my account without me 
  sharing my login & password to the actual account
  … you can attenuate these delegations in interesting ways. 
  Read-only. Or, read only a subset or a summary of my accounts 
  (say, a monthly summary only)
  … again, the issuer (bank) has to _support_ these capabilities
  … and either the bank or the resource controller can revoke the 
  capability at the same time
  … another nice thing about DCs is - if I delegate one of these 
  to my accountant, he can delegate it to his assistant
  … so, I can either delegate access to a firm, or to a person, 
  but then it's delegatable (without me getting involved)
  … I could restrict it and not allow delegation, of course. but 
  it's easier on me in many cases, if I don't have to be involved
  … key is - upon invocation, the entire chain of delegation is 
  presented
  … again, unlike typical ACL architectures
Orie Steele: I'm not sure its practically possible to restrict 
  delegation.... technically....
  … you could track the audit trail exactly who authorized these 
  capabilities, and who delegated, and so on
  … there's limitations on identifying people by keys and so on, 
  but the auditability is there
  … slide 21 - Credentials vs Capabilities
  … how I think of these things
  … so, Credentials - they're basically statements. you can 
  present em anywhere, and the business rules of the verifier 
  manage interpretation.
  … Capabilities - the business rules are set up during creation, 
  by the issuer
  … and delegation mechanisms are also constructed at time of 
  issuance
  … both are revokable
  … credentials are not delegatable or attenuatable
  … like, 'Joe says sky is blue' is just a statement, you can't 
  really delegate it
  … whereas Capabilities - are delegatable etc
  … the best use of Credentials is — authoritative credentials or 
  identity proofing
  … like, KYC (Know Your Customer) type of use cases
  … Capabilities, on the other hand, are ideal for authorization 
  and delegation
Orie Steele:  It's not practically possible to stop delegation 
  (you can share/proxy keys/proofs), but liability changes when you 
  get caught (either you delegated in an authorized way or you 
  didn't .. the latter being potentially more dangerous for you) 
  [scribe assist by Dave Longley]
  … so, once I'm onboarded onto a service (with credentials), 
  then I can manage authorization, with delegations and so on, 
  using capabilities
  … so, that's the short summary. Questions?
Orie Steele:  Awesome presentation, excellent job.
  … one of the things I learned at IIW is that the concept of 
  restricting delegation is tricky
  … has there been additional knowledge / discussion since then?
Joe Andrieu:  Great question. So, first, no keys are shared (in 
  the delegation of capabilities)
  … you could _simulate_ delegation by actually giving somebody a 
  key. But capabilities allow you to delegate without that
  … you're recording that you authorized another keyholder to do 
  stuff
  … so, a capability may say "my DID authorizes their DID to 
  perform these actions"
  … importantly, although it's not possible to prevent delegation 
  at the time, I can state that the capability is marked 
  non-delegatable
  … which matters when you examine the audit trail
  … so, if delegation is disabled on the third step, and the 
  third party further delegates it, it makes the whole chain 
  invalid
Orie Steele:  I meant more about car keys — once you give a key, 
  you can't really restrict its delegation after that
  … as far as VCs and DCs, they don't prevent somebody willingly 
  sharing their keys
Joe Andrieu: Q
Christopher Allen:  Of course, if keys are compromised, all 
  guarantees are off. You can give away or share your private keys
Kim Hamilton Duffy: I thought Orie's point is less about key 
  sharing and more about further delegation
  … the key is setting up incentives, so that it's against the 
  interest of people to share their keys
  … plus, legal liabilities after the fact
  … preserving the relationship with the issuer.
  … similar to how today, you can give your username & password 
  to your accountant, even though the bank explicitly says not to 
  share em
  … although Capabilities are similar to VCs, in some of the 
  details, they are definitely different
  … but it's clear that all the work we put into the VC data 
  model, we can use that, and build DCs on top of em
  … also, the DC may not be the sole thing that you present. 
  Instead, you could present a number of capabilities PLUS various 
  VCs
  … like proof of payment
  … (and next week, we'll talk about atomically binding payment 
  to capability)
Adrian Gropper:  I'd like some clarity to — "it's only invoked at 
  the issuer's service", and the other is "there's no phone-home 
  requirement"
  … the context is the Alice To Bob use case
Adrian Gropper: 
  https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/delegated-authorization.md
  … where the issuer is Alice, but the capability is going to be 
  exercised at Alice's chosen service providre
  … that she has chosen as a processor
  … I put in a link to this four-way chain of agents
  … that I use to describe this usecase
Christopher Allen: An issuer can require that presentation of a 
  capability can include a phone home or audit log home, etc. 
  requirement. Remember, issuers consume their own capababilites.
  … and we have a number of delegation steps in that use case, 
  for an agent scenario, that I hope we can map into the 
  Capabilities model
  … and that includes this important ones, about different 
  parties' wallets
Joe Andrieu:  It's a slight misnomer that Alice is the issuer in 
  your example. It would be the Processor that's the initial 
  issuer. which gives a capability to Alice, who can then delegate 
  to Bob
  … the not phoning home is — Alice or Bob does not need to check 
  with the processor during delegation or attenuation
Adrian Gropper:  Got it
Joe Andrieu: Q
Joe Andrieu:  Next week, the Lightning Network!
  … and that's all!

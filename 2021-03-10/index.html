<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Sarven Capadisli</span>:  Thanks for the earlier session and sharing your work, the tip of all the great work that you have <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and thanks again to the CCG for organising</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... on behalf of everyone I hope there will be a lot more of these meetings</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of shared interest</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... A brief intro.. I&apos;m Sarven Capadisli, working in web standards for about 15 years mostly through w3c</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... over the years our paths have crossed multiple times</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;ve been focussing on the solid project since 2015 at MIT as part of my research</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I worked with rhiaro, dmitriz and timbl</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as part of the early incubation period of &apos;solid&apos; that we know today</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;ve been focussing on research and developing servers and applications</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we managed to transition some of the work, eg. Linked Data Notifications, through the w3c social web wg</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... LDN is quite central to the activitypub specification and the fediverse, as well as solid</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the Solid CG.. it is relatively new, since 2018</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the underlying work goes back further, 15+ years</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are about 200 members, we work through github and gitter</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and have a forum</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are regular topical meetings covering authentication, authz, interoperability</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and others</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... everyone is welcome to join the meetings</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... they happen throughout the week, there are three right now</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;ll share the links</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... our technical reports, repos, work items are here</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Sarven Capadisli</span>: <a href="https://solidproject.org/TR/">https://solidproject.org/TR/</a> <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The CG emerged out of collaborations from many CGs and WGs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in line with the initiative on decentralising the web and empowering individuals to control their data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Solid draws a lot of background from the semantic web, linked data, read write web, webid, social web</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of existing work we&apos;re extending</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the name for it is now &apos;solid&apos;</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one way of putting the work together in a meaningful way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in the group we thought it&apos;d be best to share quick introductions to key components of the ecosystem</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and use the second half of the session for open discussions, and identify areas to collaborate</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... timbl will give an overview on the solid vision</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... aaron will introduce solid oidc spec for auth</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... justin will follow on with solid apps and interop</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... bblfish will give us a perspective on key aspects and history of solid, touching on webid, authz and potential integration with the credentials stack</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;ll hand over to timbl</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Tim Berners-Lee on Solid</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Tim Berners-Lee</span>:  Good to see you all! <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... good to be at a meeting of two w3c groups</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Solid comes from lots of places</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when I explain it I tend to find I start off in different places depending on who I&apos;m explaining to</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you&apos;ve heard lots of people talking about decentralising the web</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... its not about blockchain</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... its about going back.. the web was exciting when everyone could have their own website</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you were sufficiently geeky you buy a computer, plug it in, and you can blog and link to other peoples blogs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the excitement of the time was very much of being individually empowered</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and the wider unintended consequences were generally good</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you spend your time working on your blog, and link to other nice blogs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the result was the blogosphere became an amazing place you felt privileged to be a part, and you got more value out than  you put in</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the long tail has now gone</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now a lot of people are not on the web, but one single social network</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a bunch of projects which have always felt, and people, a spirit to get back to that virtuous circle, that feeling of empowerment</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... where I&apos;m on the web not as an alternative to the tv</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and infinite scroll my life</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... lets make it where i&apos;m empowered, tackle problems, work with people on things, and have fun, and write music and whatever</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and be empowered</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... solid to an extent is just Web</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but it&apos;s not so much a website</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... everybody has got a database</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can do picture like things on it, and edit html files, but also any data file is regarded as a database</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whereas with slower moving synchronising things like dropbox you can sync data files.. with solid, we split the world so we&apos;ve got a fast protocol with apps on the top and the storage (pod) on the bottom</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the solid protocol defines the boundary between them</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the solid protocol allows fast interactions and collaborative interactions</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... If I&apos;m typing something into a note or dragging something around a map, while I&apos;m doing that every time I move the pointer on the map the app sends back to the solid pod every update</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and if you&apos;re looking at the same app your app will connect to the server and get high speed notifications</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so that we are in sync and can collaborate efficiently</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... with whichever solid app it is</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;ve filled in the blue sky folks, tried to think about what sort of app it was, and the trouble is it&apos;s not an app its&apos; a platform</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can put lots of apps on top of it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;re aiming that the apps should be fast, compatible</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for every type of app means we have to application standards for contacts, for photos, for metadata, for playlists, etc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot out there already</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s linked data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... most files on a solid server are turtle</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... turtle is like json</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the punctuation is different</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it is natively rdf</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... easy to write rdf in turtle and hopefully to read</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of our apps .. you can also use jsonld</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... equivalent and compatible and interchangeable</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the solid protocol first added single signon for the entire world</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you want to be able to collaborate with other people you&apos;ve got to be able to share anything with anybody</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...t hats&apos; the goal</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at the moment you can only share facebook things with facebook people</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the goal of solid is to be able to share anything with anybody</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whenever someone has their id we can put them in any group</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... anyone can publish a group, just a list of people by their IDs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... everybody&apos;s ID starts with https:</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the fundamental principles like people and orgs have webids which are just https urls</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">...everything else does too</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a meeting</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one message in a chat</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the action of liking a message in a chat</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all have urls that start with https</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... nice and simple</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we started off historically with webid tls</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you had to log in with a certificate in your browser</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... i like that, it was secure, no passwords</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now we&apos;re oidc connect compatible</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can log into any solid server with an identity from any solid id provider</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you get a solid account you get an id and a pod at the same time, that&apos;s the simplest way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... or you can have several ids, tell people or not tell people they&apos;re the same</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... two interesting cases are solid id which has an anon avatar and a pseudonym</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can mint a new id which is not linked to your existing id at all</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all of the people on this call are professional, yours is going to be more like how people use linked in, you&apos;re proud of it, there&apos;s only one of them</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you want people to know</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we want people to give out their id</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... people can scan a qr code and be taken to their one professional id which has all their reputation, their papers, etc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when you comment then the public chat is tied to that reputation, so they&apos;re bound to be respectful</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... some people will have lots of ids</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... several pods as well</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one for work, one for home, one for each of your works</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I can&apos;t overestimate the lumpiness of the solid component</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... with blockhain all the nodes share the same stuff and you have to agree on running the system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... put the same effort in to keeping it running, whether you&apos;re a bank or a script kiddie making a game or to buy a candybar or something</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... whereas solid, you have several pods yourself, some are free, some are not, maybe the bank will give you a solid lock box which is expensive because you got it from the bank but they take care of you and you store things and have agreed who will take over that pod when you die</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... pods of different shapes, different speeds, reliability, different servers, but all running the solid protocol</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... same login, same access control system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we have two versions of access control at the moment, one is WAC</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... been around for years</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... another called Access control policies, which are more powerful, eg. for if you&apos;re a healthcare system and want lots of control</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the protocol is single signon, common access control, and the read-write web protocol</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we have a roadmap</div>
<div class="information">&lt;drummond&gt; Any plans for supporting DIDs?</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Dmitri Zagidulin</span>: @Drummond - there&apos;s interest, yeah. see <a href="https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/217">https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/217</a> <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;justinwb&gt; yup</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Tim Berners-Lee</span>: <a href="https://solidos.solidcommunity.net/public/Roadmap/Tasks/index.ttl#this">https://solidos.solidcommunity.net/public/Roadmap/Tasks/index.ttl#this</a> <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... link to the roadmap ^</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for the whole solid ecosystem</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the ecosystem is designed into layers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... apps is part of the whole ecosystem</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... developer tools should be another within the ecosystem</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the core functionality, the extended functionality, are what we call the solid OS</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... my feeling is that when real people use this it&apos;s got all the functionality of a phone or a mac... the goal is that it&apos;s useable by real people</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when you get a pod you get a beautiful OS which is easy to use and intuitive</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... easy to do simple things, and not to difficult to do more involved things</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... verifiable credentials is in there</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we call it in progress because people have started playing with it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... using VCs is really important</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;ll use this tracker to keep track of our progress and link in attachments, documents, implementations</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this tracker is a solid app</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the office has a different version of this tracker</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for triaging all the things people ask me to do</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is where we prioritize all the things inside the solid project</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is where VCs is currently in our roadmap</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one other view which might be useful is the view by status</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the part of the ecosystem it is, you see stuff about communities to be done this month</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there&apos;s a huge amount to do</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... because we&apos;ve now got the servers working we can turn attention building apps and operating system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of the low hanging fruit for getting governments to give pods to their citizens work really nicely with verifiable credentails</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if we have VCs we can use it for putting peoples driving licenses, VCs about age which don&apos;t reveal other thing, and digitally sign all the apps out there</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... nested and linked webs of trust where VCs are the technology for signing things</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... solid links are the way of managing my playlist of apps that I recommend, for example</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... then sign that playlist</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and the playlist will contain a hash of the app or the id of the person who made the app and anyone loading the app can know it was signed by the author</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... lots of early apps, demonstrations with VCs for places where a benevolent organization like a health system or part of a government wants to give people apps or pods so they can be enabled</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... So VCs are a part, but we have a huge amount of stuff to do</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... I work on the authentication panel where we&apos;re defining this auth protocol</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... thank you for letting us take over this meeting</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and for the presentations this morning, there&apos;s a lot of overlap</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... especially things like DIDs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for solid, all of the things tim described rely on a globally unique authentication system such that you can have globally unique identifiers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you want to be able to log in through your own authourization system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... what we have described is something that uses openid connect</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at a high level what we want to do is build on oidc in a way that works with and builds on those existing implementations and protocols</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... rather than trying to depart from that and do something completely separate</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... theres a lot of tooling out there that is mature and robust, we want to work with that rather than building out a new auth system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... solid oidc takes openid connect and builds a few additional pieces on top of that in ways that work with the current oidc spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;m not going to go into detail, you can read about it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but at a high level a couple of points are</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... access tokens are defines as jwts</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a solid pod is going to interact with those access tokens as jwts</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there&apos;s a webid claim</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the claim tells your solid pod who you are and that claim is something that is an https url that dereferences to an rdf document, and that doc contains additional metadata that can be used for validation of the token itself</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is the key area of overlap with DIDs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... lets continue conversation between our two groups</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are other parts of this related to proof of possession</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the challenges with a really decentralised system that uses access tokens, especially bearer tokens, is if you send the token ot a malicious server it can be passed on and unwittingly give away access to your data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we use dpop at the application layer, which is a way of doing token binding for these access tokens</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s in a draft spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we can go into more detail if there&apos;s need</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at a high level that&apos;s really what we&apos;re doing with solid oidc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... happy to take questions afterwards</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... your data is in those silos</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... its&apos; very hard for that person to make use of that data because of all the walls between them. integration is unlikely</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the vision of solid as tim said earlier is to give people control of their data, break all of those dots down into a personal online data stores so they can choose the apps and services they want to use</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... where is that physically stored? this view is a virtual pod. It could be made up of a number of physical pods that is transparent to the services and apps in use</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... ultimately we want to shift the equation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so different apps and services are reading and writing data from the store that&apos;s in control of the user</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the user is ultimately in control of how that gets used</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the services get the benefit of having overlaps in the data they&apos;re interfacing with</div>
<div class="information">&lt;kristina&gt; Have you looked at Self-Issued OpenID provider work at OpenID Foundation? wrt using DID/VCs with OIDC (it does not uses WebID tho)</div>
<div class="information">&lt;dmitriz&gt; @Kristina - we&apos;re tracking SIOP (and DID-related siop work) on the Solid authentication panel.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if they can make a strong proposition to the user about why they should have it, they can get access to more data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that immediately introduces some challenges you have to solve for to do this practically</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the goals we&apos;ve had in the interoperability panel is to seamless let apps read and write the same data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... different apps written by people who aren&apos;t working together, who don&apos;t have knowledge of how the other apps work</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... just that they want to read and write the same data without breaking it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... hard on its own</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... with security and collaborative use it becomes even harder</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you want to make this easy for people to use</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you want people to be able to safely share even complex data like health data or financial with other people and applications</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in a very simple intuitive way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you don&apos;t want to require them to have to think about how to organise their data to be able to do that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you&apos;re on your phone you don&apos;t want to be making those choices, just use the services and give access to the data transparently</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and you should be able to grant exactly the right access that that app needs every time</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of the work towards this over the last couple of years is in a couple of specs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... shape tree and app interoperability spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... shape trees is a way to model information so it can be interoperable</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the interop spec is about providing patterns for actors in the ecosystem to do that exchange in a constructive way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... easiest to explain this with a quick workflow</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... just a couple of things we&apos;re doing, you can join some of our meetings each week</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;ll start joining confidential storage discussion</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Bob has a bunch of data in his pod</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the first thing that the interop spec tries to focus son is data registration</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a pattern for how you store your data in a pod so you don&apos;t have to think about how to store it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we want to work towards flatter data organisation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you don&apos;t want to think about where to put things. You need some consistent pattern to apply in those cases</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you want to make it as simple as possible</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so store it based on what it is</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you have instances of these things - calendars, events, projects, stored in collections or containers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... these data, each one is a thing a person would understand</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you understand &apos;project&apos; even if you don&apos;t understand down below</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and makes it easier to validate that something is conformant to a given schema or shape if you&apos;re just saying if you put something in here it&apos;s going to validate against this</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this consistent organisation scheme makes it much easier to establish consistent authorization schemes</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... two issues to contend with</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... 1) some individual things are complex on their own</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... an instance of a task can be made up of multiple resources, shapes, schemas</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... 2) some things that are complex can be part of bigger complex things</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a task is part of a project as well as issues and releases, we need to deal with that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is where shape trees came in</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a shape tree allows you to marry the graph into the way that its stored in a collection or nested hierarchies for machien to machine interop</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it gives you structure and validation criteria or schemas</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a shape tree helps you with the layout as well as how to validate what the thing is</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... each shape tree because its explaining a structure also gives you a boundary with which to auth that data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can see a task made of multiple resources</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... virtual hierarchies, so we can talk about something like a project and be able to say issues tasks and resources can be made up of that, even if these things are stored flatly</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this becomes really powerful when you start to get into consent</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... once you have those schemes, you can share it with other people and apps</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the interop spec gives you schemes for data and app registration, and patterns you can use for consent</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so that you can grant access to people or apps based one exactly what they need</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... an app is able to express its access needs to any agent that wants to use it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you dereference the global id you get some metadata, this lines up with DIDs, that says the kind of access this app or service needs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this can be presented to the user dynamically, that allows them to specify or select exactly what access they want to grant</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... even getting down to related types</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... uses a virtual hierarchy to model complex asks in an intuitive way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at no pointing time does the app get access or knowledge to other data in the pod</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we have these patterns in use using health data</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is complicated and complex</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we&apos;re getting feedback from real patients and the thing that made me happiest was they said they were blown away by how easy it was to share their data with other people and applications and understand exactly what they were sharing and tune that easily</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... intuitive isn&apos;t usually the first thing people describe based on their experience</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we see a lot of potential for these</div>
<div class="information">&lt;heathervescent&gt; Yes, we can plan to go 15 over the top of the hour, which will give us some Q&amp;A time.</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... what ties us to the ccg is the webid work that started in 2008 under a different name</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it works quite simply</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... very similar to the DID spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... two URLs in one</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the hash url and the url that refers to a doc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the hash url refers to a person</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you go to the document to ifnd out a description which can contain a public key</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we can work out what ontologies for keys to use</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the point is so that tim can link to his personal profile and all his friends and 200 of them can link to their friends</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and the pods can be machines in your own home</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... around 2008 I presented an address book to read this type of stuff</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... its&apos; a bad UI</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now we have a lot of people working on the UI</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the UI at the time could only read because we didn&apos;t have a read-write element</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in order to do privacy you need access control and auth</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in this blog post from 2008 after asking on ietf we discovered client side certs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... now we have verifiable credentials 10 years later</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in one simple connection we can go to a web server and connect, get a client cert request, fetch the public key on the personal user profile</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we need this efficiency to connect to 200 different connects at the same time</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one problem was if you connect to 200 websites simultaneously you get 200 cert popus....</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we also want the apps to read and write</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in 2015 the linked data platform came out, that&apos;s integrated into solid</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... built on atom, and on webdav</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... these things evolving</div>
<div class="information">&lt;justinwb&gt; @heathervescent - the shape tree is more like a schema model in a database</div>
<div class="information">&lt;justinwb&gt; it gives a template for a data type - like a project - made up of multiple resources / schemas. when applications read and write data for a project, the shape tree ensure that the data is well-formed, so they don&apos;t corrupt it when other applications want to use it</div>
<div class="information">&lt;justinwb&gt; it also acts as a natural data boundary for authorization / sharing</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in order to understand access control you need each resource to point to an access control resource which describes who can access</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the first ones is public</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the server and client can use it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the client can find out if it has access and the server if it should give access</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... acl can say the protected access in is in read mode</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... can give access to a group, it&apos;s very flexible</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is evolving</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... some of the first work on access control in 2010-12</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the webid tls work fell out</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... chrome removed the keygen part</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... manu showed us the credentials stuff very early on, before this was removed, so I was still hoping browsers would do the write thing</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it was at the wrong layer of the tls stack</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the nice thing was if we look at manu&apos;s work from 2019, the 12th version of the http signatures spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is taken over by the ietf http wg</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it has a way of signing messages and signing authenticating with that at the http layer</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can do a.. you could add a www-authenticate signature and use that to authenticate</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is at the ietf but they removed this piece which allows authentication</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that&apos;s why I&apos;ve been working on trying to see how we can get manu&apos;s work back in by signign http messages from the rfc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that gives us back the same efficient that we had with tls</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so we can do a request on a resource</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... these clients can do requests on resources around the web, each resource can be protected, you have resources protected, this picture can be seen by my friends this other by my colleagues etc</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you have this www-authenticate which can come back, and use http sig to sign a header, pass a key in there</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the client can find out whether it wants to give access</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can use authorization http sig, do a request</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... sign some headers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... have the efficiency of tls but now at the right level</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can add credentials too</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you could have a credentials uri passed into the http sig</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... can be on the server, on the pod</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... also with peer to peer etension to http which is a draft (really cool)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it will allow you to place the cert on yoru client and have the server request it on the same connection</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can use OWL to describe the acls</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... eg. people over 21</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can say that all content that is adult content can be read by the class of over21</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... attribute based access control</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... just starting this work, and would like to work with the credentials group</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you think about how these credentials all fit together, I&apos;ve thought about how you could build what the credentials people call governance</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a key term in the SSI book</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in order for that to work at the global level you need a web of nations, point out which can give out credentials for age, for drivers licenses and so on, so servers an dpods don&apos;t individually need to know which agency in japan, china, france, can give out drivers licenses</div>

Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Erica Connell:  Hey hey Will and everybody um just a friendly 
  reminder that rebooting the web of trusts will be convening in 
  October the 7th through 11th in uh Ventura California people have 
  started submitting papers and um that is a great way to get count 
  on your um tickets uh early bird uh ticket deadlines are coming 
  up at the beginning of uh August I don't have the counter in 
  front of me so I don't remember what exactly they are I think the 
  9th is uh is the ticket deadline it might be the week before for 
  papers on the second uh I'll put a link in the chat for details 
  and a link to the event right all the details are there that's it 
  thanks.
Erica Connell: https://rwot13.eventbrite.com/
Patrick St-Louis:  I will a long time will chat um yeah so just 
  um.
Patrick St-Louis:  Since you you invited to people to share any 
  kind of work 1 thing that I've been working for quite a 
  significant amount of time and it's you know getting closer to 
  tuition it was to um maintain the hyperledger Aries Cloud agent 
  python uh along with verifiable credential 2.0 uh and I'm 
  currently looking at data Integrity um crypto Suites and test 
  Suites and we can now have the uh agent directly interacting with 
  the test Suites uh which is great to demonstrate interoperability 
  and and show support to the specification so just wanted to share 
  this.
Stephen Curran:  All right um.
Stephen Curran:  I am going to talk today about whoops that's not 
  good I gotta share a screen um hang on 1 second.
Stephen Curran:  Just go screen.
Stephen Curran:  All right people can see my screen.
Stephen Curran:  Okay good all right so um this is a presentation 
  um originally scheduled for way back in May it seems years ago um 
  but kept get moving around so finally here on and ready to talk 
  about hyperledger non-red in vcd format yet we all just get along 
  what just happened.
Stephen Curran:  Maybe I shouldn't have shared my screen.
Stephen Curran:  I'm not quite sure why that just happened but 
  let's go there there we go.
Stephen Curran:  Agenda about uh hyperledger and on creds and 
  then the project we've implemented recently on putting it into 
  w3c bcdm format so give some background on that and then the main 
  part of what I wanted to mention was that learnings from that 
  from taking a um a uh credential format and converting it to bcdm 
  and what we learned and then some follow-up just some brief 
  wrap-ups on how the work got done and um what's next so um for 
  those not aware I think many of you are aware of what hyperledger 
  and owns is um zero knowledge proof based verifiable credentials 
  specification and implementation so an encore a hyperledger or an 
  ENC um spun out of the indie project so um CL signatures was 
  created around 2000 to 2004 and then on creds B1 is based on CL 
  signatures um.
Stephen Curran:  It is the second generation of Cl signatures 
  implementations um and production implementations so IBM's admx 
  was there um.
Stephen Curran:  Hyperledger uh or the the implementation of an 
  entrance was part of hyperledger Indie in 2016 and that's where 
  all of this work um V1 of a non-red was established and has has 
  is essentially unchanged since then and then it became a separate 
  project at hyperledger in 2022 and the idea of separating it out 
  was to disentangle it from from um.
Stephen Curran:  Um make it uh vdr agnostic Define a 
  specification since no specification had been previously written 
  um and that specification locks in what V1 of an on creds is.
Stephen Curran:  It also the project is a place to work on V2 of 
  an on creds and that's based on newer newer being a couple of 
  years after CL signatures came out so still in the.
Stephen Curran:  Um early 2000s cryptography notably BBS 
  signatures and and later the PS signature so uh I'll talk a bit 
  about B2 at the end but just um.
Stephen Curran:  Uh briefly touching on that so A non-red V1 is 
  not a signature scheme per se it's an opinionated way to use CL 
  signatures um and and that opinionated way is to enable 
  interoperability and that's where it's been pretty successful in 
  that there are many implementations um around that use an on 
  creds um and and that allow you know a pile of wallets that use 
  it a pile of um issuers and verifiers that use it and and pretty 
  good interoperability across them.
Stephen Curran:  Um the spec the specification itself covers um 
  the data objects um from the issuer.
Stephen Curran:  Um needed by the holder in the verifier so um 
  I'll talk about that in in the next but there's a bunch of 
  objects there there's the actual verifiable credential format and 
  the presentation format so the data models and objects and really 
  that's what we're talking about in the in in aligning that with 
  the vcd.
Stephen Curran:   And then.
Stephen Curran:  Also is the interactions and data models between 
  the issuer and the holder and the holder and the verifier so when 
  a issuer issues a credential to a holder they have to do a 
  sequence of an offer a request that an issue and there's uh data 
  uh data models between each of those and then a request present 
  and verify so it doesn't talk about the protocols between how 
  those those things flow back and forth but rather here's what the 
  data is expect what the what the issue is expected to produce and 
  what the holder is going to consume in an offer and and from the 
  request from the issuer or from the holder to the issuer the 
  requests that finally actual issue of the credential.

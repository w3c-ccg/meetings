<kerri_lemoie> Hello all!
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Kimberly Linson:  Credentials Consortium at MIT um.
Kimberly Linson:  I really I I think I speak for for almost 
  everyone here I really appreciate the leadership of the DCC in 
  this community kind of helping us um.
Kimberly Linson:  Just ha have a have a sort of a I don't know a 
  beacon is how how I feel I feel about it so I'm really excited to 
  hear what you all have been up to uh and so thus I will get 
  through the housekeeping.
Kimberly Linson:  Uh stuff as quickly as I can uh this is a 
  collaborative uh environment in a collaborative space we treat 
  each other with respect and if you want to read more about our 
  conduct and about ethics and professional conduct you can go 
  ahead and and see the link within the agenda and we do invite 
  anybody this is a community group we are open to any 
  participation by anyone who has any interest at all in learning 
  more about uh credentials digital credentialing and uh however if 
  you are going to participate uh more formally you want to be a 
  more substantive contributor then we would invite you to.
Kimberly Linson:  Sign the agreement uh in the that also is 
  linked in the agenda.
Kimberly Linson:  And we keep notes uh and a recording of these 
  calls so that people can go back and and see the historical 
  record of kind of what we've been discussing as a community.
Kimberly Linson:  Oh dear do you what you want to try it again.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Harrison_Tang: Uh it says all recorders are currently busy.
Harrison_Tang:  give me a second.
Kimberly Linson:  What an odd thing for it to say.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Kimberly Linson:  Hopefully hopefully that's back.
Kimberly Linson:  Because we keep a recording and we keep um.
Kimberly Linson:  Transcript for posterity and we use the chat um 
  very intentionally to Q speakers to.
Kimberly Linson:  Didn't put links in the chat that people might 
  want to reference uh and so I'd invite you to use Q Plus if you 
  have something that you would like to say part of what I'll be 
  doing today is moderating that discussion and as people are 
  putting themselves on the Queue I'll try to keep the conversation 
  uh moving along if you decide you want to remove yourself from 
  the queue you can use Q minus.
Kimberly Linson:  Um and otherwise I think that should get us 
  going and and uh if you have any uh challenges you can just put 
  those in the chat as well and we'll we'll we'll get it sorted so 
  that you can have your uh thoughts and questions um as a part of 
  the conversation and uh now I am to introductions and 
  reintroductions does anybody uh is anybody new to the community 
  today that would like to introduce themselves or anybody who 
  hasn't been here for a while that.
Kimberly Linson:   Would like.
Kimberly Linson:  To let us.
Kimberly Linson:  Know what they've been been up to.
Kimberly Linson:  Okay I feel like I've let us be uncomfortable 
  uh silent for long enough uh so I will move on to announcements 
  and reminders does anyone have uh anything they want to share 
  with the community that they know is going on.
<kerri_lemoie> DIF Hackathon! 
  https://difhackathon2024.devpost.com/
Kimberly Linson:  Everybody is very anxious to get to our main 
  topic of the of the day Carrie do you wanna do you want to jump 
  in real quick and share about the uh the diff hackathon.
Kerri Lemoie:  Actually I was going to share let's tell a little 
  bit more.
Kimberly Linson:  Okay so I'll save it for later but you do have 
  the link.
Kerri Lemoie:  Our presentation yeah I just thought I'd put the 
  link in there for now if people want to click on.
Kimberly Linson:  Great yep the link is available.
Kimberly Linson:  All right uh and how about work items does 
  anybody have anything they want to address regarding our work 
  items.
Kimberly Linson:  Okay without further Ado Carrie and Company um 
  I'm going to let you introduce yourselves and and take it away 
  the floor is yours.
Kerri Lemoie:  Awesome thank you Kimberly so thank you for that 
  that kind intro that was really really great we appreciate that 
  we have our whole team here today everyone's gonna take part in 
  our presentation and Gillian is going to share the screens.
Kerri Lemoie:  Uh the slides I mean.
Kerri Lemoie:  Uh let her get those up.
Gillian: Okay bear with me I'm new to.
Gillian: New to jitsi.
Kerri Lemoie:  There you go.
Kerri Lemoie:  Perfect thank you.
Kerri Lemoie:  All right everybody I I don't think my my name is 
  is new to you because I'm a huge believer in the work that we're 
  all doing I'm in a co-chair of a VC edu and but today I'm here 
  with my director hat on for the digital credentials Consortium 
  and I'm here with our team to tell you more about who we are what 
  we do and um here to answer any sort of questions you might have 
  about us.
Kerri Lemoie:  Next slide please.
Kerri Lemoie:  So the this reflection thing is pretty cool anyway 
  the DCC was founded actually in 2018 um you may recognize the 
  name Kim Hamilton Duffy she was 1 of the um folks who helped to 
  found this we had um I believe uh I think I remember how many 
  members found it I think it was 12 members that founded we now 
  have 14 members and 7 different countries.
Kerri Lemoie:  The aim of the DCC was really to take the 
  expertise that these institutions had about verifiable 
  credentials and really promote that work and seek alignment in 
  with verifiable credentials in the education space so our aim is 
  really to advance the use and understanding of VCS in higher 
  education.
Kerri Lemoie:  Next slide please.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm gonna only speak a little bit here because 
  everybody else and the team has far more interesting things to 
  tell you about um but I just wanted to introduce them a little 
  bit here um this awesome team helps keep like everything running 
  we we support our members and all the various ways um and really 
  participate in all of this work and all the standards work so a 
  Gillian will tell you a little bit about our operations and 
  Community efforts um and Alex and James and Dmitri will talk some 
  about our software open source software and also our standards 
  work and our community work.
Kerri Lemoie:  Next slide please.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay so this is the slide that has the most on it 
  so I'm going to talk here for a little bit and then pass it on to 
  the team so what we do primarily is we support our members.
Kerri Lemoie:  Right um and we we try to follow their guidance 
  and their input on what is needed out of verifiable credentials 
  for higher education and with them we develop open source 
  software.
Kerri Lemoie:  Uh take their input and work on standards we do 
  some code development with them our core we have 2 types of 
  memberships we have core members and members and we do some 
  bespoke development with our our core members but for all of our 
  members we uh we do vendor advocacy so we will talk to their 
  vendors and help them understand how our viable credentials work 
  Point them to our software to help them implement it.
Kerri Lemoie:   Um we.
Kerri Lemoie:  Working on uh producing more documentation so case 
  studies so that other higher institutions um can understand or 
  and relate to like what other people have implemented.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um our open source software is all MIT license so 
  it's it's open source as it can be.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um and we develop it for their needs but we put it 
  out to the world for others to use um because uh well because we 
  believe in that we believe in Open Standards open source and open 
  communities.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm speaking of communities uh Kim Hamilton Duffy 
  actually founded VC edu the task force here at the ccg that is 
  working on um the education alignment with verifiable credentials 
  uh Demetri zagadou who's on our team is also still a co-chair 
  there.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um we're also collaborating with the open Wallet 
  Foundation we um you'll see that we have a wallet called the 
  learner credential wallet and uh we are moving our code over to 
  that organization so that we can sort of expand um input and and 
  you know brought an interest in the wallet code.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um we were uh we are very instrumental in 
  development of open badges um I I'm somebody who's been involved 
  with open badges for a very long time um we believe in open 
  recognition.
Kerri Lemoie:  For deployment support.
Kerri Lemoie:  So in addition to our membership funding which 
  helps support us toward our team we also get some grant funding 
  and um some of that includes supporting deployments of um other 
  like non-members who are implementing verifiable credentials um 
  so we do a little bit of that too.
Kerri Lemoie:  Of a research so right now we we do a bunch of 
  like research.
Kerri Lemoie:  Kind of consider ourselves a bit of an applied 
  research lab so to speak so what we do is try and stay ahead of 
  the game in terms of what education needs and um Implement you 
  know software and think about standards and and then you know 
  help other people understand it and try it out before they get to 
  it.
Kerri Lemoie:  1 Of the projects that we are working on right now 
  this year um is the issue of registry project with credential 
  engine which is another organization in our space that um has a 
  language called credential description transparency language and 
  they also have like a.
Kerri Lemoie:  Like a directory a surgeon to basically Define 
  credentials that are like employment and education related.
Kerri Lemoie:  And we're working with them to um.
Kerri Lemoie:  Sort of look into when research and prototype.
Kerri Lemoie:  She were Registries for Learning and employment 
  records specifically so we are evaluating any trust registry that 
  we can find.
Kerri Lemoie:   We are.
Kerri Lemoie:  Are looking into governance specifically related 
  to education and and employment credentials.
Kerri Lemoie:  And I will be building out prototypes of testing 
  those out with our software releasing all of this is open source 
  and then putting out a report in the spring with some 
  recommendations.
Kerri Lemoie:  We think about this as like foundational research 
  for issue Registries and we hope that others will be able to take 
  that and you know build upon it from there.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um Alex will talk a little bit more about how we 
  are also working with uh render method in our wallet doing some 
  PDF rendering of credentials.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um Demetri might mention a little bit about 
  something we've just started working on just wallet attached 
  storage which is a way for individuals to choose where they want 
  their credentials to be stored versus just in the data on the 
  mobile wallets.
Kerri Lemoie:   And then.
Kerri Lemoie:  Also we recently did some issuer issuing load 
  testing.
Kerri Lemoie:  Hopefully we get that report out by the end of the 
  year and we did this this is an example of how we work.
Kerri Lemoie:  We did this because 1 of our members told us well 
  we issue like we might sign 20,000 credentials at once you know 
  what what do we need for servers to do that so we started testing 
  that out so we could let them know we thought we'd write it up 
  for the community so we should have that up soon.
Kerri Lemoie:  And then also if that isn't enough stuff to keep 
  us busy we also do like advocacy and education so we're 
  participating in something called the ler higher ed accelerator 
  and this is um run by Acro which is a the registers organization 
  in the US and um at least 12 other organizations in higher ed who 
  are promoting the use of verifiable credentials in education um 
  and this is a huge thing um because they are going to be pushing 
  on vendors and registers to start implementing this.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm also you know we we write white papers and uh 
  we have a new blog that we're starting to publish to more 
  frequently.
Kerri Lemoie:  All right I think that is pretty good rundown of.
Kerri Lemoie:  We do I'm happy to answer questions later on but 
  I'm going to pass this on to Alex.
Kerri Lemoie:  More about our software.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Great thanks Carrie.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): So like Carrie mentioned uh we do work on a a 
  lot on open source projects and I'll talk a little bit about them 
  here all together they make up our issuer holder verifier 
  ecosystem we listed them here with some QR codes in case you're 
  interested in checking them out um checking out the repos or you 
  know just some more information on each and I'll just briefly go 
  through our list the first of 2 James will talk about in a later 
  slide.
<kerri_lemoie> Link to slides: 
  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VWr-zaRoK4HkN8zTRliaq2ZxqdozjLdGVE6MxiiMVdo/edit#slide=id.g2f6cd62a585_0_645
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): So the issue coordinator issues microservices 
  in the app works by coordinating calls to a signing service and a 
  status service each of themselves running as Express apps which 
  uh with all 3 apps running together within Docker compose but 
  I'll let James talk a bit more about that later.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): The admin dashboard is a system for providing 
  groups like Enterprises schools and organizations with a 
  straightforward way to issue VCS in bulk and again James will 
  talk about that.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): The learner credential wallet is a 
  cross-platform IOS and Android mobile app for storing and sharing 
  digital learner credentials.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): And verify our plus is our DCC hosted website 
  for verifying credentials and allows users to verify any 
  supported digital academic credential and uh it's made with um 
  next.js.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): So next slide please.
Gillian: Are you seeing okay.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Thanks so I'll go into the wallet itself here 
  and this is where we house our learning credentials you can see a 
  screenshot here of our UI and how we present the VCS to the user 
  the wallet specification that we used is uh based on the w3c 
  universal wallet interoperability specification and the w3c 
  verifiable credentials data model it gets a port from the US 
  Department of Education this wallet is react native based which 
  means it could get published to both IOS and Android seamlessly 
  which really helps with development.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Anyone can Fork this wallet on GitHub and 
  customize it for their Institution.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Um we do provide templates as well.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC):  uh it's.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Private and that we don't collect or store 
  information on our end um about you know the users's info it also 
  render method that uses HTML over SVG since we noticed that some 
  of our users of the wallet had trouble displaying long names when 
  exporting to PDF.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): And the wallet is fully open source it uses 
  the VC data model open badges 3.0 VC API as well as trappy and uh 
  signature methods and Open Standards too.
<kerri_lemoie> We aim to present on our use of renderMethod some 
  time in the future!
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): And going forward we're currently in the 
  process of transitioning ownership of the wallet to the open 
  Wallet Foundation over at the Linux Foundation um with the hopes 
  of garnering more um open source Community Support in continuing 
  to develop the wallet.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Next slide please.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): All right our verifier plus project is a DCC 
  hosted site for verifying VCS it's a tool for uploading 
  credentials and it allows users to verify any supported digital 
  academic credential it uses unique public links in the form of 
  URLs for sharing online that can be destroyed whenever so hence 
  its privacy preserving because sharing isn't tracked uh the VC 
  shown here is just an example um that can provide a public link 
  for credentials also sharing on LinkedIn via the wallet where it 
  gets uploaded to V plus which provides the public URL and for 
  anybody here that's interested if you wanted to just kind of test 
  this out I provided a link to a spreadsheet where you can buy 
  provide your name and email address and we can send you a sample 
  credential via email.
Alex_Higuera_(DCC): Uh and I think that's it for me I'll pass it 
  over to James now.
James Chartrand:  So Alex went over the uh holder and verifier 
  parts of the ubiquitous or Bible credentials triangle and I will 
  talk a little bit about the issuer part of that triangle.
James Chartrand:  It's basically it's very simple um it's just a 
  set of services that are VC API conformant these are dockerized 
  nodejs apps Express apps.
James Chartrand:  Um we publish images for each of these apps in 
  dockerhub.
James Chartrand:  Um and the part of the reason for that is just 
  so that we we don't want people when they're trying out the 
  software because we've we found that a really important part of 
  what we're doing as Carrie said is advancing the use and 
  understanding of verifiable digital credentials and a big part of 
  that is trying to make it as easy as possible for our members to 
  evaluate the software and also to understand what's involved with 
  digital credentialing um so by splitting everything up into these 
  much smaller um discreet Services is it allows some of the people 
  that are doing the evaluations so specifically the tech people at 
  the different universities and colleges.
James Chartrand:  Kind of under the hood and understand exactly 
  what's going on so for example with the signing service they can 
  see oh I post a verifiable credential to the signing service and 
  I get back the same verifiable credential with the proof that's 
  been attached so it's kind of a way to help them understand um 
  more easily what's going on.
James Chartrand:   So we.
James Chartrand:  Images to Dr Hub um.
James Chartrand:  And as I said these Services can be used 
  individually like the signing service or they can be wired 
  together um in typically in something like a Docker compose that 
  simply references the images and Docker hub.
James Chartrand:  Um a prime example of how the services can be 
  put together is the admin dashboard that we have um so this is a 
  Docker compose that wires together uh a bunch of the different 
  services so the workflow coordinator bitstring status list um the 
  signing service and a coordinator as well as uh the UI front end 
  for um.
James Chartrand:  Acting with the credentials.
James Chartrand:  So some of the features of the dashboard um for 
  those of you that want to give it a try and again the dashboard 
  is kind of a nice way to get into um the services that we offer 
  uh we've got a Docker compose put together that you can get to 
  from the link that's up at the top of that slide there the 
  deployment guide and you can start up that Docker compose very 
  easily with a single command provided you've got Docker installed 
  on your computer and if you do then you can fire it up and then 
  you can take a look and see how we've made it um pretty easy for 
  people to upload CSV data into the admin dashboard browse some of 
  the credentials that they've uploaded set up a template for the 
  VC that you'd like to issue set up an email template for the 
  emails that will get sent out to the recipients of the 
  credentials um and a way to.
James Chartrand:  Do exactly that send the credentials out so 
  that the recipients receive emails.
James Chartrand:  Um we've also got relocation in there and again 
  I mentioned that we use the bit string status list um so that you 
  can go in to this admin dashboard and do the revocation.
James Chartrand:  Um some of the documentation that we provide 
  for all of this is that we've got GitHub readme for all of the.
James Chartrand:  GitHub repositories and they're pretty 
  comprehensive.
James Chartrand:  The deployment guide which again is linked um 
  from the top of that slide tries to provide an introduction for 
  specifically for our members um so for people that might not be 
  so familiar with everything that's involved with setting up a 
  digital credentialing system uh to try to take them through you 
  know some of the issues and point out some of the choices that 
  they have.
James Chartrand:  Um as part of that deployment guide we've also 
  got starter compose files so you can take a look at those and you 
  can fire those up which will fire up our simple issue with 
  coordinator or the Advent dashboard and let you get going and try 
  it out.
James Chartrand:  That's about it.
James Chartrand:  I will pass it over to Demetri.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right uh yeah so uh as part of as part of 
  the work that uh Carrie and Alex and James described uh we we 
  come up against basically all the corner cases and a lot of the 
  specs we work on in the ccg.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh we we came up uh against for example let's 
  take uh the render method so we created the issuer service 
  verifier service and a wallet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And 1 of the things that we kept hearing from 
  customers is okay but can I print this to a PDF I've got this 
  verifiable credential is there is there any chance I can make a 
  PDF out of it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And so we're like okay uh yeah let's explore 
  some of that and we took a look at the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The early sort of uh specifications being 
  worked on in the various communities.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh comp.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and and took a look at the render methods 
  Prospect and we're like yeah let's let's use this and so we we 
  put together a um a prototype demo of this is how you render uh 
  credential using a template that is carried inside the 
  credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and our helpful helping along with that 
  spec so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Basically all of the specifications that we 
  use if we such as you know verify the credential but also the 
  protocols like VC API the data models like 1 AD texts uh open 
  badges version 3 which is based on verifiable credentials uh 
  whenever we come across a a corner or an edge case that doesn't 
  have uh What uh what the use case needs or what the education 
  space needs we like to contribute back to the specs and and work 
  with all of you.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Uh to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Make it happen.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So that's basically what this slide is about 
  uh the CTL advisory groups thing is interesting because so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We've just started talking about sort of trust 
  Registries in this community right over the last couple of couple 
  of years.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh we we understand that when you hand 
  somebody a verifiable credential and it's signed by a key.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is opaque to the verifier or it did rather the 
  did is still opaque with a verifier uh and so they need to look 
  it up somewhere in some directory that says okay uh this opaque 
  did is mapped to this known entity and the entity is authorized 
  to issue such and such credentials so we need a spec for that and 
  there is uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Half a.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Current specifications that are that are 
  dealing with that including ccgs verified issues and verifiers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The open ID foundations open ID Federation 
  spec uh the diff um I forget what I was forget what it's called 
  Uh trust establishment spec.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh but also trust over IP uh and and a bunch 
  of others right so there's a number of applications so what the 1 
  of the projects were involved in with credential engine is 
  basically comparing and contrasting all of the trust registry 
  specifications.
<kerri_lemoie> More on the Issuer Registry Research Project: 
  https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/104B3XcWilwLfIXO8VqaF_ym7yl8w77ZX?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And then picking 1 or 2 and operating a 
  registry for a year and and writing about what it was like to 
  operate so it's that kind of work of first look at the existing 
  specs see which ones need to be expanded and then let's get some 
  Hands-On implementation experience with it so that we can uh 
  feedback to uh to the various organizations.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh I think I'll I think I'll stop there and 
  and hand over to the next uh slide.
Gillian: Awesome thank you Dmitri let let me just run through 
  this and and Carrie's got a few more points and then yeah we'll 
  be happy to to take questions from the group um part of our a big 
  part of what we do at the GCC is is also working to make sure 
  that um materials and resources that help people better 
  understand um how they can both Learners using their data issuers 
  providing the best um options for their clients and verifiers 
  learning the best way to obtain skills or to to learn about the 
  skills and achievements of of folks um it's by making these 
  resources available publicly um and so just um an overview of 
  where and how we offer these things our website digital branches 
  at Mita edu has some white papers and research on it um but our 
  Wiki which is linked here um is quite a trove of information that 
  is ever growing so it contains info on on their private 
  credentials in general and how and and our rationale for 
  promoting their adoption.
Gillian:  in higher education.
Kerri Lemoie: https://lermap.t3networkhub.org/
Gillian: Um and also the the case studies that Carrie mentioned 
  earlier um I uh are all of our open source code is available at 
  our GitHub or uh in here and I think we'll share these slides out 
  with the group afterwards I imagine um so that you have that link 
  and also the link that um directly to to the deployment guide so 
  you can see more um about the how to deploy the issuer tools and 
  the the learning credential wallet is James and Alex were talking 
  about earlier um some of you may have already heard about the 
  cellar ecosystem map this is a collaborative effort to kind of 
  map the ecosystem to show who the different stakeholders that are 
  involved in the learning learning and employment record or L 
  ecosystem how they what their work streams are where they 
  interact and um what are some kind of action items folks can take 
  to promote adoption um we host quarterly Community calls that are 
  spotlighting the interesting work that's being done in the space 
  um whether that's around you know a verifiable credentials or um 
  developing interesting like approaches to governance for micro 
  credential.
Gillian: Those types of things.
Gillian: Um if you're if you have an initiative that you think is 
  cool and and aligns with the DCC please feel free to reach out 
  and we we can talk about potentially hosting you on a community 
  call um and then um to we're going to mention a little bit more 
  about membership I think in a slide but just to to dangle the 
  carrot um we do have a technical working group that's for for our 
  members we hold those monthly um and some other and plenty of 
  other uh um internal meetings for our member institutions but we 
  also do host um Tech and membership office hours and so once a 
  month um and I can send follow up with information on like when 
  those are exactly and how they do require registration so how you 
  can register for them um but if you're if you're not a member and 
  you just have um tech support questions you can join the tech 
  office hours um and Alex and James and Dmitri or 1 or all 3 um 
  some combination will be there to answer your questions and then 
  once monthly if you if you have an inquiries around membership 
  and what's a different benefits are um I host the membership 
  office hours um.
Gillian:  once a month as well.
Gillian: Those are open.
Gillian: To the public um.
Kerri Lemoie: Membership: 
  https://wiki.dcconsortium.org/app/page/1-J7FgCK_jubicOukzhDWlI7IIZcbe1CXgitoaz_V724?p=1h1VJHHv2zSe0n9Ltg-KQevSuqWbGcExy
Gillian: Real quick because this kind of scrambled to get to add 
  1 last slide about membership um there is plenty of info on on 
  the wiki about this so we have 2 tiers of membership who are 
  member and member the main distinction being that um we we do 
  Focus much of our efforts on supporting the goals and needs of 
  the the membership in the entire Consortium but the the former 
  the core members get much more kind of bespoke um technical 
  support so if there's something in core member 1 or needs we will 
  you know see prioritize um creating or iterating on that 
  technology um but if you're interested um if you represent a 
  post-secondary or higher education institution anywhere in the 
  world um we we encourage you to to reach out um Carrie I'll hand 
  it back over to you for anything I missed about um membership or 
  and and these announcements in general.
Kerri Lemoie:  No you did great thank you and thanks everybody um 
  before I get into the announcements um you know I just sort of 
  want to re-emphasize um our focus on our membership and um I'm 
  not sure we'll ever be like a very huge um organ like a you know 
  Consortium we want to be big enough that we are.
Kerri Lemoie:  Addressing needs and learning more right we like 
  to just really really believe in global interoperability and we 
  really believe in um individual access to their their data and 
  privacy and so we we know this is a very important angle and we 
  know that the education space is very interested in this and we 
  really do believe in community and that's what we're trying to 
  build out um at the DCC um so um yeah if you know of anybody who 
  is interested please have them reach out and we'll help you be 
  happy to talk to them.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um okay yeah so some announcements um diff 
  hackathon I mentioned this so I put the link in the chat earlier.
Kerri Lemoie:  If you haven't heard um diff is hosting a 
  substantial hackathon it's going on right now through November 
  4th um that link right there will um will get you to the page 
  that explains more.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um hold on I was just going to pull it up so I 
  could look at it too.
Kerri Lemoie:  Bear with me here.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um so the education and let's see there.
Kerri Lemoie:  Okay so the education strand the education 
  Workforce strand has a whole bunch of um different challenges um 
  1 is for um demonstrating um applications where people are using 
  verifiable credentials so this 1 is pretty open this is for 
  Learning and employment experiences um we're looking for people 
  to propose you know credential types data models um and show how 
  they can be used.
Kerri Lemoie:  We're also looking for um more power in VC tools 
  so multiple language support because we know that we all need 
  that but we really need an education um especially to promote 
  like cross border Mobility um and also browser integration on 1 
  of our members had suggested wouldn't it be great if we could 
  just have more browser integration with a verifiable credentials 
  um maybe even using render method right um how can you plug in a 
  VC into the browser and just look at it because part of what we 
  want to do is really encourage um you know not just understanding 
  but ease of use.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um other also other tasks that you could do as 
  part of the hackathon 1 is to use render method um to help.
Kerri Lemoie:  Uh to suggest how credentials could be displayed 
  in the learner credential wallet this came right out of um 
  plugfest feedback so all of these these tasks are really based on 
  a continuation of the plugfest that jmf and VC Edge you had in 
  the past.
Kerri Lemoie:  So uh we are really looking at like how can we 
  display credentials better in wallet um because we know there's 
  so much data that could be displayed how would wallet decide what 
  to show.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um and also the same for verifier plus we are sort 
  of looking for ideas as how to improve verifier plus because it's 
  all open source we welcome anybody to join um and get prizes the 
  prizes are pretty substantial um between like 2000 and 2500 for 
  some of them so definitely check that out and join us for that.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um next coming soon so um we are working on a work 
  item for the ccg um it kind of got paused just due to travels and 
  conferences um working on this um with jmf and also diff and 
  others um this is a working on an item for a credential template 
  directory.
Kerri Lemoie:  This is a place where people could put examples of 
  data models and credentials um.
Kerri Lemoie:  To help others you know understand how to build 
  out the contents of VCS.
Kerri Lemoie:  We at the DCC we we don't really focus on the 
  insides of the credentials although we try to support what our 
  members need but what we really want to do is provide examples so 
  people can understand how to do it and the more similarities we 
  have right the the more interoperability will encourage.
Kerri Lemoie:  So um stay tuned for that we're filling out the 
  forms and should be back in a few weeks or so to present that 
  here.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um and then also um what we're working on with our 
  members is a degree credential template which would go into this 
  template directory um and we've been working with our members and 
  also looking at the European learning model to determine what a 
  degree could look like as a verifiable credential using standards 
  like open Badges and European learning model.
Kerri Lemoie:  So we like to get some examples out to the world.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um and and help people understand why verifiable 
  credentials um are great formats for degrees.
Kerri Lemoie:  Then lastly I'm just putting iaw on here like most 
  people here know iaw is coming up sadly I will miss it but um 
  most of our team will be there and um I hope you all have a great 
  time.
Kerri Lemoie:  And um that is it for our presentation I believe 
  unless the team is anything else they'd like to add that I 
  forgot.
Kerri Lemoie:  Or otherwise opened a questions.
Patrick St-Louis:  Um I have a quick question about the sharing 
  feature of the wallet uh when you mentioned sharing is it just 
  the wallet would display the credential for a software to um um 
  have a look at or are you are we talking about sort of a 
  presentation request based sharing from the wallet.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um I'll start that answer Patrick but I don't I'll 
  hand it over to the team to get into more details um 1 is that we 
  make it possible to create a share link like a public URL that 
  goes to verify it plus.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um an individual could create a link for their 
  credential um and then shared anywhere like on LinkedIn and where 
  have you and it would show as verifiable in real time.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um but we do also um do like exchanges and 
  presentations and um maybe I'll estimate tree if you might want 
  to describe Demetri how we set that up.
Kerri Lemoie:   With the.
Kerri Lemoie:  I'm putting him on the spot here.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Sure yeah no problem uh so if I understand if 
  if I understand your uh question correctly Patrick uh this.
Kerri Lemoie: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-render-method
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This rendering template is it just for the 
  wallet is it for other software uh and the answer is so 
  fortunately it can be used for both uh render method for for 
  those who are not familiar with it I highly recommend uh taking a 
  look at the ccg drafts back uh its various things 1 is uh yes 
  it's uh it's an aid for how to display unfamiliar credential 
  times right so at the moment pretty much all wallet 
  implementations for each new credential type.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The the display screens are hardcoded that 
  that's that's how it started out and so when the question becomes 
  so what happens if we want our wallets to be general purpose what 
  happens when a wallet um encounters a new and unfamiliar 
  credential how do we display it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Well we can dictate a couple of fields in 
  common right we can say oh we would very much prefer if all 
  verifiable credentials have a uh a name property or a description 
  property that way our wallets can at least display that um so so 
  that that's 1 approach the other approach is of course to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Have this uh list item rendering template and 
  yes of course there's um all sorts of security considerations you 
  want to make sure that whatever template that you use whether 
  it's SVG or HTML or something else that you want to want to make 
  sure and sanitize it um tend to make the the display secure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But yeah so displaying the wallet is 1 use 
  case for render method uh Second Use case is for any sort of 
  verify or relying party once they receive the credential uh it 
  would be nice for them to be able to be able to display to the 
  user new and unfamiliar credential types.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and then and then the third sort of major 
  class of use cases is to switch between different display 
  modalities for example how would you render a credential in audio 
  for conversational interfaces how would you render a credential 
  for a braille uh or other uh assistive technology.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And how would you uh how would you under a 
  credential when somebody hits print right so we have a chance 
  just like HTML web pages.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Where when you hit print there's a technology 
  for the designer to be able to control what happens there's print 
  directives in cascading stylesheets this is a similar sort of 
  thing for okay what what I want to print out the credential or 
  when I want to export it to another format such as PDF.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The the software can turn to the render method 
  template does that answer your question.
Patrick St-Louis:  Um that is interesting over that wasn't 
  exactly my my question but this was all interesting information I 
  was asking more on the concept like if I have a wallet I have I 
  don't know a couple diplomas in there and then I need to present 
  1 of these specific diplomas to a verifier is it my job to select 
  which 1 I represent provide uh public URL and then show this to 
  the verifier or is it a way for the verifier to ask the wallet 
  directly and then sort of the wallet front me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The latter well so yeah great question uh so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  At least in the way we're using it so far and 
  in the way the the render method paper was um sort of envisioned 
  uh it was it's not meant to communicate the structure of the 
  credential during presentation.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh there are other the other specs that do 
  that for example the Pres the diff presentation exchange that 
  tries to do that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So here the idea is not that the render method 
  the template.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This beats directly in the exchange protocol 
  it's more that once the requests are received the credential once 
  the verify receives the credential how they display it afterwards 
  does that make.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah yeah makes a lot of sense.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yeah yeah can I just 1 more so regarding the 
  uh you said when I get issued a credential I get the share URL um 
  is there any mechanism to prevent uh like credential hijacking so 
  it was mentioned that these URL could be deactivated so I guess 
  they are just random URL that are generated and it's based on the 
  fact that only the recipient would know this URL is there 
  additional sort of authentication mechanism to these URL or 
  they're just really a public URL that someone needs to know to 
  get the credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah great question great question uh so let's 
  talk about that so I think the share URL problem is going to be 
  familiar to any of you who are wallet implementers right the 
  moment so say we get everything right we have our issuers working 
  we have our nice wallets uh we've got the workflow where uh let's 
  say a student gets a diploma or a course completion credential 
  into their wallet then the question becomes so now what what can 
  they do with it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   And 1 of the.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Asked uh sort of features is well can I email 
  it to someone or can I text it to someone.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So the first set of generation of 
  implementations just added it as an attachment like literally the 
  raw Json of the credential just slap it as an attachment to an 
  email an email very doable uh very easy to implement.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Problem is of course the receiver doesn't know 
  what to do with it so what us and a lot of uh other teams 
  independent leads have stumbled against is I would be nice to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Instead of sending it as an attachment to save 
  the raw Json of the credentials somewhere accessible on the net 
  because then you can do 1 of 2 things you can either send the 
  direct link although you have the same problem as an attachment 
  what's the receiver going to do with raw Json.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh a better yet you can feed that link to a 
  viewer app so uh sending example.com my VC Json you can say 
  example.com viewer app and then pass in.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That um just a couple of things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Is to start with you know implementation uh 
  we just started with public credentials with no access control so 
  it is it is a random link uh to and we're careful in the UI to 
  say okay now remember this is just for public credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Because anybody can pass along your link and 
  and people will be able to view it there right so don't don't put 
  highly secret things uh don't use this method for sharing for 
  highly secret credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  As as we can all probably picture that that's 
  very limited we don't want to just rely on the UI and user 
  instructions for anything like that so we do want to add.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Some kind of access control their uh now 
  because the user can hopefully controls the storage that they're 
  uh that they're saving it to that they're sharing it to the user 
  can always delete the credential from from that storage so the 
  link breaks and again that's not that's not the best experience 
  but at least the user has that uh sense of control the user can't 
  for example and this is this is a very real uh example that uh 
  that works right now I can save like manually download the raw 
  Json put in my Google Drive and then share share it as a file and 
  then I can use the authorization uh from Google Drive Right the 
  either people or groups or anyone with the link right I can use 
  that but we're also and this is where the concept of wallet 
  attached storage comes in uh we'd also like to standardize right 
  like we we don't want all of these disparate cloud services like 
  Google Drive and Dropbox and fund drive and all of these things 
  all of them have uh slightly different incompatible clients and 
  different incompatible Access Control models.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It would be great if we could use some of the 
  stack of bids and verify the credentials and authorization 
  capabilities to uh to standardize to unify that storage interface 
  so that wallet users can uh can get used to it can can start uh 
  getting educated about it so hopefully that answers your 
  question.
Patrick St-Louis:  Yes thank you.
Harrison_Tang: Yeah um I'm just curious like where are we on the 
  kind of the adoption cycle in other words like our uh higher ed 
  uh institutions like uh issuing the credentials or vert use using 
  this to uh verify or if not yet like uh where are we on that.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah I can speak a little bit to that Harrison so 
  some of our members we know are issuing verifiable credentials 
  some of them are issuing them as degrees and some of them are 
  issuing um as a micro credentials or or just um you know badges.
Kerri Lemoie:   I would.
Kerri Lemoie:  Kids still really early like we are still really 
  much ahead of the curve so that project that I spoke about the uh 
  the Lear higher ed accelerator is really intended to bring on 
  board understanding in in higher ed um 1 of the reasons the DCC 
  is focusing on on degrees versus other types of of credentials um 
  in education is because a lot of Institutions are already issuing 
  some kind of digital format of a degree so it's an easy 
  conversation to have with their it Department.
Kerri Lemoie:  You're not there where it's early but that's like 
  part of what we're doing and so we're trying to make it you know 
  easy to understand and um as useful as possible so that um you 
  know we start increasing adoption.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um open that is 3.0 just was finalized this last 
  spring.
Kerri Lemoie:  So I think there are many institutions who are 
  just keeping an eye on what others are doing and I expect for the 
  next couple years we'll see a lot more issuing.
Kerri Lemoie:  Um I should also say here and said that on the 
  verifying side so a lot of.
Kerri Lemoie:  A lot of work that's happening in the education 
  and Workforce space has to do with something called skills-based 
  hiring and they are really focused on working with employers to 
  Define skills inside of these credentials and um that will will 
  help people get jobs so I think there's a lot of work being H 
  happening right there in terms of um of that work and so for like 
  social Mobility helping people get hired faster help people get 
  hired who don't have degrees um that kind of stuff.
Harrison_Tang: Started and by the way just a quick note you 
  probably know already know this but a lot of companies when they 
  do a skill-based hiring the skills definition uh we just use a 
  LinkedIn Talent insights and then I know LinkedIn has spent a lot 
  a lot of money and a lot of resources like categorizing and like 
  do standardizing these definitions so.
Harrison_Tang:  uh you might.
Harrison_Tang: I want to look.
Harrison_Tang: You haven't accessed uh haven't looked into it 
  yeah.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah thank you Harrison.
Kimberly Linson:  Patrick oh no uh sorry Stephen.
Nate Otto: +1 Lots of work happening on skills-based hiring. Need 
  even more focus on verification experiences for learning 
  credentials for skills based hiring use cases (included 
  understanding the skills and including trust navigation of 
  issuers.. consumers won't necessarily know which issuers they 
  want to accept credentials from in advance)
Stephan_Baur: Yeah thank you I.
Kimberly Linson:  Was ignoring you Stephen.
Stephan_Baur: I was not quite sure how this works with the Q Plus 
  finger um my question is I assume in the um educational VCS you 
  use a date for the subject to bind it to the person.
Stephan_Baur: Of that I'm kind of thinking well so if I can 
  actually store the credential for a long time that's good but if 
  I cannot store the private key Associated to the subject did um 
  then I can no longer really prove that I am the person that is 
  bound to and of course you can refer back to first name last name 
  and things like that to to link it um but the challenge I just 
  want to double-check is is is that true are you are you using a 
  subject date and and if so what kind of sort of operational 
  practice does need to be established for people to to know they 
  need to kind of store the private key as well um for decades 
  right when they still want to you know prove that they are 
  actually the person Linked In the VC.
Kerri Lemoie:  Yeah and that that is a great question I I'll say 
  a little bit here but others in the team might want to jump in um 
  I I can explain mechanically that we're using did key um when 
  someone uh you know downloads the wallet installs it we create a 
  profile Associated um with a did key um and they can create 
  additional profiles for digital DS if they'd like and then when 
  they request the credential from the issuer um that did is sent 
  to the issuer so that it can be signed as part of the subject of.
Kerri Lemoie:  The credentials um part of why we're looking at a 
  degree data models is the identity part um degrees are are 
  considered somewhat I I won't say legal officially but you know 
  they're more legal documents and they often contain uh like names 
  right so in these cases right now we are just really relying on 
  on putting um identification like names inside of the uh the 
  credential subject.
Kerri Lemoie:  New we we haven't really done too much about you 
  know storing the keys forever um but I I assume Demetri and 
  others on the team like may have something to say about that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah it's a great question and I think all the 
  verticals are going to need to answer that question and not just 
  education like Kerry mentioned uh 1 of the reasons it's nice to 
  work in education as a vertical is low expectations meaning 
  people are already used to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  To looking at a lot of the credentials such as 
  diplomas or uh public certifications as public credentials so 
  there's less privacy concern there's less user push back for 
  using their legal names because when applying those legal names 
  are still going to be checked and so on I'd like to look at uh 
  this question of should you use DDS in a credential on a spectrum 
  right so imagine uh a left to right Spectrum on uh the very left 
  are low threat low value credentials such as I don't know uh 50 
  cents off coupon off of breakfast cereal you can model that 
  coupon as a verifiable credential do you need to bind it to a 
  subject well not in all cases in some cases the the credentials 
  are so low value low threat that you might not even need to 
  bother you can just use them as Bearer credentials all the way on 
  the other end of the scale is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  High value High threat use cases where 
  Biometrics are required right so it's not only are you going to 
  have a subject did and and bind it cryptographically but the use 
  case requires for legal reasons that uh legal identity is bound 
  to it a picture voice print and so on right so imagine uh 50 
  cents off coupon on 1 1 end and access to a military installation 
  on the other.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So credentials with only a did but no legal uh 
  no no legal identity.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Narrow band in the middle of that Spectrum uh 
  to like to the left of that band you don't need the legal and to 
  uh to the right of that band you are required to have the legal.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  But but but the number of use cases where we 
  can get away with just the subject did without anything else are 
  actually fairly narrow so I want I want everybody to keep that 
  in.
Stephan_Baur: 3 meter just so real quick then maybe was it is it 
  then true that you you would bind to the subject date or you 
  would not or you would just simply leave it optional.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For the moment uh we're leaving at optional 
  for our issuers uh to see to see how it all develops.
Stephan_Baur: Yeah I I think it would be valuable.
Stephan_Baur: To make the private key in if you have a wallet as 
  well to make the private key exportable as well and then you just 
  store in a highly secure environment the credential and yes 
  actually the private key matching to it so that you online at 
  least can can prove ownership over it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The fun you should mention I I totally agree 
  uh 1 of the 1 of the specs that were uh collaborating with diff 
  on is specifically a wallet export container a secure container 
  where you can export not only the credentials but also the DS and 
  private keys with all of the caveats uh and security warnings of 
  doing that.
Stephan_Baur: Exactly yeah thank you that that clarifies it 
  thanks.
Kimberly Linson:  All right well thank you everyone thank you 
  everyone from from DCC for sharing with us and I hope everyone 
  has a great rest of your day.
Kimberly Linson:  Look forward to seeing you.
Kerri Lemoie:  Awesome thanks for having us.
Kimberly Linson:  Thank you anytime.

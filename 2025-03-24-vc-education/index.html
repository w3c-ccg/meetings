<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Just by way of introduction my name is Sharon Lou and I work in an organization called jobs for the future um jobs for the future is a national nonprofit in the US um we had our 40th birthday a couple of years ago but essentially our goal is to enable 75 million people who face systemic barriers to advancement to work in quality jobs this is 75 million in the US um and so a lot of the work that we have done traditionally has focused on um transforming the education and Workforce systems here. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Um but um our team at jmf Labs specifically thinks about how can technology be a tool for us to accomplish these goals. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Um this is what we can we call a jmf Labs Market scan it&apos;s part of the insights function of our Labs team which is not only to look at what all of the cool shiny things are in our ecosystem but to really think about the opportunities that Technologies provide us to really transform um the ecosystem of education and work as well as to fundamentally give opportunity to people um so if you want to check out some of the other Market scams um I guess the live I will share uh the deck and the live links presumably will work um in that. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  We are starting with this idea of we are looking at digital wallets um this is a Gartner quote that I think a lot of people had um 500 million smartphone users worldwide will rely on digital identity wallets so this was an interesting topic for us um. <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Because what this is actually a refresh of a market scan we had done in the past and we don&apos;t typically do like a refresh of a market scan because I don&apos;t know there&apos;s just many more topics for us to explore um. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Because of the evolution of um healthy and used we thought it was different enough from the 2022 version that we put out like the ecosystem had changed enough the use cases were different enough that we could tell a different story so you see here um our original uh Market scan the the sort of static link for all of this body of work is still jff.org digital wallets um but really thinking about all of the different changes that have happened um since so you&apos;ll hear us tell a story hopefully successfully of um not only the wallet itself as a place to store and share your digital credentials but the way that the larger um community and ecosystem can use these tools um. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Publish a number of different goals so um let&apos;s get into this so um we started where we started in 2022 and which is sort of the foundation of a lot of the work we do which is about the talent Marketplace um 2022 we put this graphic out which we really like which is that we want um digital credentials um to be controlled by the user um in a way that allows users to store multiple credentials from multiple issues um over a long period of time and then to allow them to share these credentials as they pursue opportunities in employment and education um foundationally and fundamentally this is what we think is critical. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Providing opportunity and actually a really important tool um this is still true and so um oh actually before I get to the next slide I should say 1 other disclaimer we do highlight a number of companies in the same way that we did before 1 of the things that we did try to do was tell stories about the impact on a number of different users so this isn&apos;t a catalog of um things you can buy because we think they&apos;re cool um this isn&apos;t this is an ad space necessarily for any of these companies so don&apos;t take these as uh endorsements or it like there&apos;s no sort of like uh coupon code or you know friend code to to any of these companies these are just stories that we thought communicated that the impact that this technology ecosystem um. <a id="link-38" style="display:none;" href="#38">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Sharon Leu</span>:  Um this was our first and most basic use case can you store and share your credentials a variety of them um in your in in a digital wallet and can that actually lead to opportunity um but then as we were thinking reflecting on the last sort of the progression of this infrastructure over the last 3 years we started to see that there was like in addition to doing this there were other things that um we could do so 1 of the stories that we highlighted is the story of um credit Vera there are you know digital wallet company as are all of these but in addition to storing and sharing your digital um like your education credentials in your licenses um the tool allows um employers to easily be able to see um. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>

<ildiko_mazar> Can you start the recording and transcription, 
  please, Dmitri?
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right excellent yeah so uh that there's 
  potentially exciting news so the where a task force of the w3c 
  ccg who uh has recently had a discussion about upgrading the 
  meeting note taking and and call infrastructure.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's uh there's consensus to upgrade to.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Who meet and some open source uh Auto 
  transcription uh that that would be probably slightly better than 
  what we're using.
<ildiko_mazar> fingers crossed
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Here with jitsi so uh we'll we'll work with uh 
  the chairs there get all the details and uh pretty soon we'll 
  probably be switching over to Google meet.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  How's it going it's fingers crossed that's 
  right yeah so should should be good okay uh recording uh no 
  introductions do we have any Community announcements.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh please raise your hand we we use uh jitsi 
  QQ up basically you click on the raise hand button and it gives 
  you up in order.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The main sort of uh event that I'm aware of is 
  we've got internet identity Workshop coming up in April in 
  Mountain View California for those of you who can make it it's 
  always it's always a good time and speaking of uh here's Kalia 1 
  of the organizers.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh all right any other announcements hi Kalia 
  I was just talking about IBEW coming up.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh big 40 that's awesome hey how does time 
  even work.
<eric_shepherd> Unfornately im not hearing audio
Kaliya Young:  I I don't know.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  That's so exciting wow.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh yeah all right uh any other announcements.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Okay in that case let us move on to our main 
  topic.
<eric_shepherd> I only see the transcription
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Today we have uh we have Sharon Lou to talk 
  about uh various things uh including and not limited to the 
  market scan Sharon uh over to you thank you for thank you for 
  joining us thank you for.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Apologies, I don't hear 
  anything except that applause and "Recording is on"...help?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh sharing your findings.
Sharon Leu:  Um can you hear me.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We can indeed.
Sharon Leu:  Okay so I'm going to just comment first a couple 
  people in the chat have um pointed out that they can only hear 
  the strange jitsi noises and not any of the audio is there 
  something that you can type into the chat to help with that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah so okay yep can do that.
Sharon Leu:  And I'm going to try to share my screen so let's see 
  if that works.
<dmitri_zagidulin> those who don't hear sound - try switching to 
  a different browser
<dmitri_zagidulin> try Chrome or Safari, etc
Sharon Leu:  Uh open system preferences hold okay.
Sharon Leu:  Um are you seeing my screen.
Sharon Leu:  Okay great um so what I'm going to do is um well 
  thank you first for having me on and giving me a chance to talk a 
  little bit about um a recent work product that my team has uh 
  released.
<eric_shepherd> Im using the app
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Eric - i see, try connecting on the web then?
<dmitri_zagidulin> the app sometimes has trouble with our version 
  of Jitsi server
Sharon Leu:  Um what I'm going to do I'm going to talk a bit 
  about this project I'm going to run through just a few slides 
  very quickly um and I would love for us to be able to have a 
  conversation about what you all thought um and let's see um if I 
  can do slideshow mode and still.
Sharon Leu:  Okay is this is this like is this the screen but not 
  like.
Sharon Leu:  The other stuff.
<ildiko_mazar> I never ever managed to connect to these calls via 
  the app, @Eric, try the web
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Yeah we we just see the title screen verify 
  the credentials.
Sharon Leu:  Great okay perfect so all of this works um so we so 
  let me just talk a little bit about um who is jmf what is this 
  project and the thing itself which is um our 2025 Market scan of 
  uh digital credential wallets um so here's our debt which 
  basically follows the outline of the report of the market scan 
  I'm not going to read the market scan to you obviously but.
<eric_shepherd> @Ildiko. Thank you! üôè Will do.
Sharon Leu:  Of sections in it um talks a little bit about the 
  context of the skills first talent Marketplace um and how it can 
  lead to a systems level transformation some of the what we 
  considered and saw to be the foundational components of that key 
  opportunities for impact the work ahead and I think as we discuss 
  we can talk a little bit about The Cutting Room floor AKA um 
  either juicy bits or extraneous side quests that were left out 
  because we exceeded our page count limit.
<eric_shepherd> I‚Äôm in and audio is now working
<dmitri_zagidulin> @Eric - excellent!
<ildiko_mazar> FYI, you can find the report at 
  https://www.jff.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JFF_Verifiable-Credentials-Wallets-in-a-Skills-First-Talent-Marketplace_Mar-2025_2.pdf
Sharon Leu:  Just by way of introduction my name is Sharon Lou 
  and I work in an organization called jobs for the future um jobs 
  for the future is a national nonprofit in the US um we had our 
  40th birthday a couple of years ago but essentially our goal is 
  to enable 75 million people who face systemic barriers to 
  advancement to work in quality jobs this is 75 million in the US 
  um and so a lot of the work that we have done traditionally has 
  focused on um transforming the education and Workforce systems 
  here.
Sharon Leu:  Um but um our team at jmf Labs specifically thinks 
  about how can technology be a tool for us to accomplish these 
  goals.
Sharon Leu:  Um this is what we can we call a jmf Labs Market 
  scan it's part of the insights function of our Labs team which is 
  not only to look at what all of the cool shiny things are in our 
  ecosystem but to really think about the opportunities that 
  Technologies provide us to really transform um the ecosystem of 
  education and work as well as to fundamentally give opportunity 
  to people um so if you want to check out some of the other Market 
  scams um I guess the live I will share uh the deck and the live 
  links presumably will work um in that.
Sharon Leu:  We are starting with this idea of we are looking at 
  digital wallets um this is a Gartner quote that I think a lot of 
  people had um 500 million smartphone users worldwide will rely on 
  digital identity wallets so this was an interesting topic for us 
  um.
Sharon Leu:  Because what this is actually a refresh of a market 
  scan we had done in the past and we don't typically do like a 
  refresh of a market scan because I don't know there's just many 
  more topics for us to explore um.
Sharon Leu:   But because.
Sharon Leu:  Because of the evolution of um healthy and used we 
  thought it was different enough from the 2022 version that we put 
  out like the ecosystem had changed enough the use cases were 
  different enough that we could tell a different story so you see 
  here um our original uh Market scan the the sort of static link 
  for all of this body of work is still jff.org digital wallets um 
  but really thinking about all of the different changes that have 
  happened um since so you'll hear us tell a story hopefully 
  successfully of um not only the wallet itself as a place to store 
  and share your digital credentials but the way that the larger um 
  community and ecosystem can use these tools um.
Sharon Leu:  Publish a number of different goals so um let's get 
  into this so um we started where we started in 2022 and which is 
  sort of the foundation of a lot of the work we do which is about 
  the talent Marketplace um 2022 we put this graphic out which we 
  really like which is that we want um digital credentials um to be 
  controlled by the user um in a way that allows users to store 
  multiple credentials from multiple issues um over a long period 
  of time and then to allow them to share these credentials as they 
  pursue opportunities in employment and education um 
  foundationally and fundamentally this is what we think is 
  critical.
Sharon Leu:  Providing opportunity and actually a really 
  important tool um this is still true and so um oh actually before 
  I get to the next slide I should say 1 other disclaimer we do 
  highlight a number of companies in the same way that we did 
  before 1 of the things that we did try to do was tell stories 
  about the impact on a number of different users so this isn't a 
  catalog of um things you can buy because we think they're cool um 
  this isn't this is an ad space necessarily for any of these 
  companies so don't take these as uh endorsements or it like 
  there's no sort of like uh coupon code or you know friend code to 
  to any of these companies these are just stories that we thought 
  communicated that the impact that this technology ecosystem um.
Sharon Leu:  Um this was our first and most basic use case can 
  you store and share your credentials a variety of them um in your 
  in in a digital wallet and can that actually lead to opportunity 
  um but then as we were thinking reflecting on the last sort of 
  the progression of this infrastructure over the last 3 years we 
  started to see that there was like in addition to doing this 
  there were other things that um we could do so 1 of the stories 
  that we highlighted is the story of um credit Vera there are you 
  know digital wallet company as are all of these but in addition 
  to storing and sharing your digital um like your education 
  credentials in your licenses um the tool allows um employers to 
  easily be able to see um.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Grant impact, great!
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Sharon Leu:  Like existing like uh.
Sharon Leu:  Problems in context right so you know like the 
  digital credentials and leers they're just you know 1 of the 
  things but you know we hear a lot as we work um with our 
  stakeholders like you know maybe there are a lot of credentials 
  but you know there are not you know it's it's a classic cold 
  start problem for us like there are there enough credentials are 
  there enough verification tools is there a demand is there Supply 
  just sort of thinking about how to prioritize the needs of um 
  stakeholders like job Seekers um in order to sort of like fill 
  out this uh these ecosystem tools um.
Sharon Leu:  Something that we think is particularly important 
  um.
Sharon Leu:  Maybe this gets to what did get left leave left on 
  The Cutting Room floor is this idea of safeguarding privacy and 
  like how to communicate the importance of that and to um sort of 
  work towards that um in a way where it like sort of.
Sharon Leu:  Respects the Legacy structure of like centralized 
  data collection reporting and the efficiencies that that provides 
  um balancing them with some new and not new not really new but 
  sort of newly in the news issues related to individual privacy.
Sharon Leu:  Um we think that there's significant amount of work 
  that needs to be done to just as awareness to combat domain 
  specific isolationism and what we mean by that is you know you 
  know it's great to have an education and work force task force in 
  a lot of these contexts.
Sharon Leu:  But creating more sort of Niche education specific 
  uh tools data models definitions May ultimately impact the 
  interoperability of these in the the larger sort of system 
  context um and then finally sort of understanding um the 
  relationship that a lot of these small decentralized projects 
  have in the context of movements that occur in sort of the big 
  Tech spaces um so I think that like um I added work items and 
  maybe this goes a little bit on Cutting Room floor because this 
  didn't work in there um I know that um Carrie lemoy and several 
  others of us have had a number of conversations about future work 
  items that we might propose um to this group as well as to like 
  the main ccg group um of tools and things that we think could 
  actually contribute um.
Sharon Leu:  You the tools and resources that would enable people 
  to start using these Technologies in the context of education and 
  Workforce um so I will just stop talking there and um maybe I 
  don't know if there's like questions I can't see but um I'll pop 
  over and.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you yeah no uh this this is fantastic so 
  uh 1 1 question that I immediately see from Don from Don in chat 
  what about self assertion or peer recognition.
<pl> @Don Presant - as you know we're working on peer 
  recognition/self-assertion
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And Such live verifiable claims and then we've 
  got ildico on the queue.
Sharon Leu:  Like do I think it's important or like can you 
  elaborate on the question.
Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_Canada: Um sure uh basically to say 
  that um I'm wearing my open recognition hat here I was just 
  presenting about it last week uh the idea that uh recognition 
  should not just come from above from um a um.
Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_Canada: Recognized agency or 
  institution uh there should be room for um recognizing your peers 
  saying who you are and why you recognize this person and even 
  making your own self assertion and saying here's me here's my 
  evidence you can trust that all these this is true and this is 
  all verifiable claim I'm just wondering if that's part of the 
  actively.
Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_Canada: Managed or the actively 
  planned ecosystem.
Sharon Leu:  Um so I think that's an excellent point and I think 
  that it's non-inclusion should not be um I think you should not 
  infer that like we don't think that's important we know actually 
  Demitri you're working on endorsement in some of um we we just 
  like it just wasn't like.
Sharon Leu:  Hadn't been enough progress on it for us to identify 
  it as like there's a thing that we can like Point people back to 
  does that make sense.
Don_Presant,_Learning_Agents,_Canada: That would be great that 
  might be a great topic for epic this October to say it.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Oh sounds good.
Sharon Leu:  Yes um I mean looking at you Dmitri right because 
  you are doing all the work on that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Happy to talk a bit more about it I just want 
  to make sure um Isla goes up next on the Queue and then I'll hop 
  on and talk about endorsements and so on uh go ahead It Go.
Sharon Leu:  Okay I don't want to like okay I I I want to stay on 
  topic and I'll say first that um the credit Vera use case um was 
  easy for us to write about or we wanted to write about it because 
  it was a solution that was designed um specifically for an 
  employer so the fact that there were missing requirements what 
  like went back to how the employer defined like green and red 
  right so you saw like some people got a green light they could go 
  on site some people had a red light um and in that case um the 
  employer had a very specific list that they populated with the 
  vendor and said if a person has you know these certifications or 
  these like skills demonstrated in this way then they are allowed 
  on site right so it's an access pass.
Sharon Leu:  Had 4 out of the 5 things you've got a red but if 
  you have 5 out of 5 um you could go on and then that like very 
  clear definition allowed them to say you have 4 out of the 5 
  here's the 5th 1 that's missing right.
<pl> Peer recognition is also a part of the proposed Arya 
  ecosystem in First Person credential they've proposed.
<ildiko_mazar> It is definitely a very good and solid start
Sharon Leu:  That's not always and so we liked that because um I 
  think that um a lot of times in education we build things and 
  hope people will use them so we make a lot of digital credentials 
  we congratulate ourselves on the billions and billions of digital 
  credentials.
Sharon Leu:  1 Of the things that um we've been working on at JFS 
  is thinking about well how do these uh credentials find um their 
  sort of like uh calling in life right like how does how do these 
  credentials actually Grant access to work opportunities for 
  people and asking employers that question often leads to 
  different answers right so a construction company says you need 5 
  pieces of you know like qualification to be on site but every 
  employer is going to answer that question differently and this is 
  the trick right um can you work with every single employer to 
  clearly Define what they want in a particular job role for a 
  particular job and map it back I think that there are the 
  beginnings of that work um I think that also the question is like 
  when do you check these because traditionally what we would say 
  in traditional Workforce Development is when you are applying for 
  a job could an employer through their applicant tracking system 
  just.
Sharon Leu:   Pick off.
<ildiko_mazar> Absolutely! So basically the employer has the 
  liberty to be as inclusive or exclusive as they wish
Sharon Leu:  Certain people or is the employer somewhat committed 
  to providing this training um in this case of the construction 
  company they didn't want to check it when during the application 
  process they wanted to check it um standing at the work site 
  right so it's also um being able to understand like when is a 
  employer going to use which kind of credential for what purpose 
  um and can an ecosystem be developed so that credentials are the 
  tool that they use um so that's like 1 part of it is like in that 
  it is easier or harder depending on um how you design with an 
  employer.
Sharon Leu:   The other.
Sharon Leu:  Heard of your answer is I think that you're never 
  going to understand skill unless you are hiring a commercial like 
  someone to drive a truck and you they need a commercial driver's 
  license um that piece of identity document is not actually meant 
  to be uh qualification for a job role and this is where it 
  becomes a little bit more complex and again understanding the 
  sort of uh end user the sort of demand side needs of um that 
  ecosystem to put together like what are all the credentials and 
  which ones give that information and actually even thinking about 
  what is the information inside the credential um that needs to be 
  there and how does it need to be displayed in order for um a 
  person to be able to use it I feel like these are very very sort 
  of.
Sharon Leu:  Unexplored not non explored but I think there's so 
  much more there that needs to be done for us to be able to 
  release claim ecosystem is robust enough to actually give you 
  know this kind of opportunity so I think what we tried to do is 
  tease the possibility that this can happen encourage people to 
  start thinking about it holistically.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you so much Aaron.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right so uh I'll hop hop on the Queue uh 
  to talk a little bit about self issued credentials uh peer 
  recognition self attestation so first of all what do we mean by 
  that.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh and and why is it important and what needs 
  to happen in order for it to play a major role in our verifiable 
  credential wallet and issue and verify our ecosystems.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So 1 common example of a self asserted 
  credential that we use all the time.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh that that might be useful to structure our 
  discussion around is a resume.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Do as the as the applicant are putting 
  together this document either as a as a text document or in some 
  cases some job application marketplaces uh you're putting it 
  together as sort of a structured data model behind the scenes but 
  the point is you're laying out a number of claims such as I went 
  to this and this University I have the following skills I I went 
  to these clubs and got this recognition right all of those 
  things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   At the moment.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All of those are self assertions and play an 
  important role in like in our world in our life but here's what's 
  important to note.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  In order to be really useful.
<nate_otto> Recognition in da club is usually very informal but 
  sometimes imporant
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The self assertions need to be the claims need 
  to be backed up by evidence and and that's 1 good good way to 
  think about it what do we need.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  This uh what needs to happen in order for self 
  assertions and and peer recognition to play a larger role in 
  verify the credential 3 things.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  1 Is there needs to be a strong emphasis on 
  evidence right I'm claiming claiming this thing and to back it up 
  here's here's the evidence for example.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh I went to this club.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It is my.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Especially as the as we grow the verifiable 
  credential ecosystem.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Most claims most facts even institutional ones 
  won't be available in the digitally signed form right the club I 
  went to existed 10 years ago and since has disbanded of course 
  they're not.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Of course no to verify the credential is 
  coming but I can at least do a self assertion and let's say 
  attach an image uh I take a photo of my acceptance letter to the 
  club right more more relevant uh more more likely I'm making a 
  skill assertion right since we're talking about skill-based 
  hiring I can say I'm a barista I know how to make uh perfect 
  latte art and it can attach a video of My Demo right of my latte 
  art night competition at the the local coffee shop or I'm a 
  developer I claim I know how to how to do HTML and I attached as 
  evidence my GitHub repository with with the source code so that's 
  thing number 1 what do we need for uh essentially for self 
  assertions to win we need an emphasis on evidence fortunately at 
  least data model wise uh not much needs to happen there it's 
  already included into the data model especially for example in 
  the open badges version 3 they hit a model there's an Evidence 
  field.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We got everything.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  We just need to make sure that our issuing 
  platforms support evidence and of course that are verifying 
  platforms.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  It easier for verifiers for humans looking at 
  this stuff to pull up the evidence to examine it to make 
  judgments on it and so on so evidence is number 1 uh number 2.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh as as Don mentioned and uh is incredibly 
  important what makes self asserted claims stronger.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> endorsement=secondary 
  (indirect) evidence
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Collab uh collaboration and recognition and um 
  endorsements from peers so I claim uh I can make latte arts and 
  in support of that here is a also self asserted claim from my uh 
  shift manager of my my supervisor that you have to meet she knows 
  how to make latte art or uh here is a self assorted credential 
  self sort of claim from my um from my peers that says yes to me 
  she knows how to I don't know write HTML so so that's uh that's 
  number 2 and what do we need in order to make that happen uh so 
  that's 1 of the 1 of the things that uh we're exploring for 
  example uh with Phil Long and the T3 Chamber of Commerce 
  Foundation of writing a couple of uh open source uh application 
  to demonstrate the workflow to to show what an app would look 
  like that allows you to make self asserted claims and then get 
  feedback get recommendations.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   Get endorsed.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  From other people.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh so and here we we have now a pair of 
  verified credential 1 a claim and the other 1 is a credential 
  about that claim confirming or refuting and so on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  The third element that that needs to happen 
  Force officer credentials.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is of course the element of identity.
<pl> Evidence in a secondary assertion/endorsement is in the 
  substantiation of the endorsers background with evidence that 
  they're in position to make such a judgement corroborating the 
  initial assertion
Dmitri Zagidulin:  If if we're saying that hey uh claim from my 
  supervisor adds to the the believability of the credential how do 
  we know what the person is my supervisor right we need and and 
  here that's that's the hardest um challenge of all of those 
  that's where we get into the notion of personhood credentials 
  issuer Registries and the thing about issue Registries and and uh 
  hopefully next week we'll be able to talk about those uh I'll do 
  a issue registry 1 on 1 uh presentation.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh those are super important and uh Baseline 
  in fact I wanted to ask Sharon uh the the question of in the 
  market scan in talking with all these vendors what have you how 
  what what's the level of awareness that you've seen for the need 
  for issue Registries and verify Registries but we'll come back to 
  that in just a second so so the third element for.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Is uh the notion of identity is the notion of 
  issuer Registries is okay if we have backup evidence for my 
  peers.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> NB: Peer recognition is 
  more than endorsement, can also be like a reference letter: "I 
  nominate this person"
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And how do we know that those are our peers 
  and that I didn't make it up etc etc.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So far most of the work on issue or Registries 
  has focused on institutional Registries for for very good reasons 
  uh those are those are easiest to get started with those are 
  easiest to regulate and in some markets in verticals those maybe 
  the only things possible for example uh if you recall ABC's 
  European blockchain.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Initiative uh who who we're doing an ABC did 
  methods uh they did 2 versions uh ABC did version 1 was for 
  institutional issuers was for organizations essentially and those 
  were kept in a directory went through a kyc process uh on signup 
  and so on.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   But the reason.
<pl> The third element Dmitri described suggests that identity 
  through notarized assertions is a key element that we need to add 
  to our ecosystem.
<ildiko_mazar> EBSI: European Blockchain Services Infrastructure
Dmitri Zagidulin:  They had a second did type the reason they had 
  a did version 2 separate from from version 1 and it wasn't a 
  sequential know you both both are needed in parallel with 
  specifically for natural persons was for humans those cannot and 
  must not go in a directory for those the process of uh know your 
  customer and identity verification is a lot more perilous than 
  for public companies or nonprofits or clubs or organizations 
  which are public sort of by.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   By their.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  For humans it's the exact opposite so.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  There's never going to be especially if we do 
  our job right there's never going to be directories of all the 
  humans ever or all the humans in um even a jurisdiction even in 
  tightly controlled uh legal jurisdictions like the European Union 
  they are specifically making an informed explicit choice not to 
  make that available to to in fact Outlaw it.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Love this Natural person 
  exploration...
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So then if we don't have directories uh for 
  these issuer Registries how do we handle this notion of identity 
  for peer recognition and for um for for evidence uh of claims and 
  here much like much like often verified with credentials if you 
  notice we fall back on existing.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Could also explore 
  triangulation, a la ORCA
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Existing techniques existing social and legal 
  techniques in this case that of uh notaries essentially that's 
  that's not the only approach of doing it but that's that's 1 of 
  the things that we're exploring for example in uh in our projects 
  with uh Phil and the T3 Chamber of Commerce foundation and that 
  is how do we how do we verify identity in a casual peer-to-peer 
  Way in real life in paper-based credentials well for when 
  applying to institutions they have their own institutional kyc 
  process but what about when dealing with parts of the person and 
  when buying a car or not buying a car when when.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Between between peers and the answer is at 
  least in the US but also in a lot of other countries system of 
  public notaries uh and note what the notaries do they don't.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   They're not.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Subject matter experts when.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  What I'm making a claim on a resume or a 
  signing form signing a legal form that's that's making a claim 
  they don't examine the form and determine whether or not the 
  claim is true that they can't if if I'm if I'm putting on a form 
  that I know how to write HTML they can't test me and my coding 
  skills but they can.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Up my passport or driver's license my 
  government identification whatever I got going for it and at 
  least verify the identity and verify the act that I was there in 
  person with them on such and such a date and sign this document.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And that's the that's the pattern where.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We're exploring.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Pursuing in in these prototypes so to 
  summarize uh selfishly credentials super important especially as 
  the verified credential ecosystem is uh doing bootstrapped 
  because not everything is going to happen institutional.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Institutionally issued credentials in fact the 
  vast majority of things in fact about history is not going to be 
  institutionally uh.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Nerdy Q: "Was I observed 
  producing this evideence?"
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Additional issued so we need we need a 
  solution for these vast use cases uh that that that aren't 
  covered by uh traditional issues.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Important use case what do we need for it uh 
  we need to figure out how to do identity and this notion of issue 
  registries.
Dmitri Zagidulin:   We need.
<pl> Notaries aren't subject matter experts - but they are 
  experts in determining identity, and in formal documents that 
  they have they characteristics of validity (bank statements, 
  ultility bills, etc. are such artifacts)
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Need to emphasize evidence and we need to 
  emphasize um endorsements recommendations and uh.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Dear feedback all right so that was a lot of 
  talking apologies this is super interesting topic.
<don_presant,_learning_agents,_canada> Love to explore this 
  further at epic.openrecognition.org
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Let's let's go to the key let's see who else 
  is uh Q.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Please of course.
Sharon Leu:  Um okay so that was really great and I'm glad we got 
  to talk about that and also I appreciated your question about 
  who's asking for Registries and um I think that um when you do 
  the the registry 101 it'll be really really good for people to 
  think about this because actually um.
Sharon Leu:  The observation that we have is that like No 1 will 
  say oh yes like we must okay only certain people will say we must 
  have an issue or registry and you're right that those are the 
  technology developers I think it's stakeholders who um need to 
  understand trust will ask for um what amounts to be a registry um 
  without saying those 2 words trust registry does that make sense 
  like um I think that people are deeply appreciative of what a 
  trust registry gets you functionally um without having said those 
  2 words um.
Sharon Leu:  I think that there are many examples um I myself in 
  the former um in the former employee of an organization that um 
  no longer exists slash soon will no longer exist and like if I 
  need to Pro produce evidence that I once was an employee of said 
  Organization for example like the the like very real world 
  implications are things that people deeply understand I will say 
  that something that um so I'll tease this uh it's not quite ready 
  yet but in this sort of like.
Sharon Leu:  Things in addition to like Registries the ability to 
  like endorse in self- issue did see from a number of different 
  um.
<pl> They greater the risk associated with accepting a credential 
  the more open people will  be open to a seek trust registries.
Sharon Leu:  Solutions providers is um especially if they're not 
  natively um in education or Workforce company breaking in to the 
  education space can be difficult and 1 of the reasons it's 
  difficult is because of the variety of financial types that could 
  potentially exist um and so 1 of the ideas that we have for a new 
  work item at the ccg is a directory um of credential data models 
  um so you can imagine all the different data types that we would 
  want for their to be interrupts to be interoperable across the 
  ecosystem like not only like an employee ID or you know 
  employment verification but student ID um.
<pl> ... open to seek out trust registries ...
Sharon Leu:  There's a ton of work on transcripts obviously um 
  but you know just even other of the different credential types um 
  it would be useful for I think I think that it would be useful 
  for people who are trying to understand how digital credentials 
  work within the education space to have that as well as to align 
  within our existing education ecosystem but that's sort of like 
  just a hypothesis that a few of us have um would be really 
  curious if others in this group agree or or like have other 
  suggestions.
Nate Otto: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-extensions/#credential-schema 
  Credential Type/Schema Registry is this what you're suggesting?
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Thank you so much uh Sharon that's that's 
  fantastic any other questions and and I by the way I completely 
  agree with you that a uh directory of examples is going to be 
  super important to developers and other stakeholders to see what 
  the state of the art is.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And I think uh Nate Otto posted a link on go 
  ahead Nate you're on um.
Nate Otto:  Oh yeah yeah just uh to mention on that link there is 
  a uh VC uh credential extensions directory which lists 
  specifications um that Define credential types and there's not 
  very many of them so far I was surprised that really there's been 
  a slow start to the community or formalizing various different 
  um.
Nate Otto:  Schemas for different uh purposes for credentials but 
  I think that we we are starting to see some more popping up and 
  they just haven't yet been added to this uh directory here um and 
  I just got on the cutest A+ 1 plus a thousand to what Sharon said 
  about how users will ask for trust Registries is what they want 
  is the capability to understand that the issuer identity 
  information that's being presented to them is authentic and 
  matches some kind of real world institution users don't 
  necessarily.
Nate Otto:  Know how that capability is going to be provided they 
  just want that check mark on the uh credential like it exists on 
  um you know like say services like social media websites that 
  offer verification and I think over time the.
Nate Otto:  Public understanding the consumer level understanding 
  of the capabilities of that trust Mark will grow like for example 
  just watching the drama over the Twitter blue check over years 
  for somehow I got into the my algorithms thought that I wanted to 
  read a lot of articles about the blue check mark which I totally 
  did it was relevant to my interests I guess I clicked on them a 
  few times and so it was really interesting to see that 
  journalists had a pretty robust understanding of how that check 
  mark was provisioned the various different policies under girding 
  it and um we could have a really broad public conversation about 
  the various fine grained texture elements of the Twitter 
  verification ecosystem even though that was only 1 company 
  providing 1 very binary check mark and within the open badges 
  space we are going to have and broader VCU space.
Nate Otto:  We're going to have a bunch of different issuers we 
  have a bunch of different Registries and hopefully we can be 
  delivering good enough value that the users can start depending 
  on it and learning really about like what.
Nate Otto:  Is the services that backs up that value whose trust 
  is it that is being um remarked on when we're looking at a 
  verification record of a credential.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Someone else questions comments.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  Uh go ahead Phil.
PL: Yeah I just wanted to elaborate a little bit on the I think 
  the important discussion that we just had on on the use and value 
  of recommendations and point out that 1 of the things I think 
  that's going to emerge as an interesting question is those kinds 
  of recommendation uh graphs if you will that are public um versus 
  those that are done in a manner that retains um some degree of 
  privacy in the form of a kyc excuse me a form of a a zkp approach 
  where there is a evidence of a recommendation but they only the 
  only information exchanged is that this recommendation has been 
  offered from some uh some anonymous source or some protected 
  Source in the in the Privacy sense um because it is that's 
  actually 1 of The Elements that's been built into the a uh Ira 
  um.
PL: First-person trust credentials that um Drummond and Company 
  have been uh advocating recently and I think it's an important 
  question for us to consider as to how public we want and and what 
  circumstances we want these recommendations changed to be totally 
  public versus um um protected in a way that conveys some degree 
  of consistent um endorsement without necessarily disclosing more 
  than needs to be disclosed in that process thanks.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right um we are near the top of the hour.
<sharon_leu> Thank you for having me and for all the people who 
  helped!
Dmitri Zagidulin:  So here's a good place to wrap up Sharon thank 
  you again for talking about the market scan uh really look 
  forward to reading it uh if you want to share how people can get 
  in touch with you if you have questions.
<sharon_leu> jff.org/digitalwallets
<sharon_leu> sleu@jff.org
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right yeah so we've got jff.org digital 
  wallets for more information.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  And and we've got uh Sharon's email address in 
  chat.
Dmitri Zagidulin:  All right that'll be all for this week thanks 
  again Sharon thanks everyone uh talk to you all next week cheers.

[2021-04-13T16:13:07.550Z]	<pete_M>	Jack_Tanner: current Verification methods have one key, this new type allows for multi signatures
[2021-04-13T16:13:47.501Z]	<Orie_>	big +1 to the work item
[2021-04-13T16:13:49.104Z]	<pete_M>	... a new proposed verification method, also a way to show relationships between DID methods. More sophistication for secure identities
[2021-04-13T16:13:50.320Z]	<Orie_>	very much needed

[2021-04-13T16:14:51.122Z]	<rgrant>	q+ does this type help support multisig within a given method?

[2021-04-13T16:16:49.744Z]	<pete_M>	Jack_Tanner: the design is intentionally recursive

[2021-04-13T16:17:51.800Z]	<pete_M>	... there are a few other considerations to subtypes not in this work proposal
[2021-04-13T16:18:22.399Z]	<pete_M>	... some might lead to security concerns, and we didn't have clear use cases

[2021-04-13T16:20:15.557Z]	<pete_M>	rgrant: one question i have is: is this a signature scheme or a DID method? What exactly is it?
[2021-04-13T16:21:05.855Z]	<Orie_>	q+ to note that did methods don't always express their VDR constraints

[2021-04-13T16:25:10.031Z]	<pete_M>	markus_sabadello: verification methods dont have to be based on cryptographic signatures
[2021-04-13T16:25:44.885Z]	<pete_M>	... this method combines other verification methods without concern for what they are
[2021-04-13T16:26:00.757Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: any comments or objections?
[2021-04-13T16:26:38.941Z]	<pete_M>	... Jack, do you have a repo to transfer over

[2021-04-13T16:31:09.163Z]	<pete_M>	... trying to get the API to work across different vendors

[2021-04-13T16:33:35.213Z]	<pete_M>	... the Tracability API seems like a fork to the specification without proper discussion
[2021-04-13T16:34:08.829Z]	<Troy_Ronda>	q+ (would like to see defined back-end APIs for facilitating VC/VP exchange).
[2021-04-13T16:34:11.250Z]	<heathervescent>	q?
[2021-04-13T16:34:28.052Z]	<pete_M>	... it shows we are working, but we should discuss the actions more
[2021-04-13T16:34:33.895Z]	<kimhd>	+1 to Heather and Manu. This move severely compounds my concerns I raised in the vc-http-api PR
[2021-04-13T16:34:54.020Z]	<Orie>	merging from forks is how progress is made
[2021-04-13T16:35:13.915Z]	<heathervescent>	ack Orie
[2021-04-13T16:35:14.512Z]	<TallTed>	+1 fork of not-really-understood/described/discussed thing to even-less-understood/described/discussed thing is premature and likely to lead to less interop, not more
[2021-04-13T16:35:37.608Z]	<heathervescent>	@TallTed, would you like to be on the queue?

[2021-04-13T16:35:49.748Z]	<pete_M>	Orie_: i agree with manu about wanting to work
[2021-04-13T16:36:09.762Z]	<manu>	q+ to note, this isn't a fork in the traditional "quick update to spec" sense... this is a fork in a "completely different work item" sense.
[2021-04-13T16:36:16.378Z]	<pete_M>	... there has been long conversation about VC-HTTP-API which has led us here
[2021-04-13T16:36:19.116Z]	<Kimhd>	q+ where have those calls happened? Are they open only to the SVIP cohort?

[2021-04-13T16:37:45.999Z]	<Kimhd>	forks are not combative; the language in the work item is combative (as well as refusal to accept use case feedback)
[2021-04-13T16:38:22.450Z]	<pete_M>	... there's been no consensus on what the Traceability API people have been trying to do
[2021-04-13T16:38:26.371Z]	<manu>	I strongly disagree with what Orie is saying and the way he's presenting the information; what he is saying has not been my experience.
[2021-04-13T16:38:51.398Z]	<TallTed>	repeating the same words again and again is not productive use of time.
[2021-04-13T16:39:01.916Z]	<pete_M>	... progress needs to be made to see if the changes are worthwhile

[2021-04-13T16:44:15.086Z]	<heathervescent>	Thanks all for your agreement to discuss the work item at a call next week.
[2021-04-13T16:44:15.620Z]	<pete_M>	Kimberly_Linson: lets start with: "Why is there a CCG 101?" We want more people to contribute
[2021-04-13T16:44:48.560Z]	<pete_M>	... working with RANDA Solutions, we are passionate and excited for VCs
[2021-04-13T16:45:28.306Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	juan AND KALIYA'S
[2021-04-13T16:45:41.944Z]	<pete_M>	... personally, I have a 101 level understanding of these conversation topics, and now I need to understand the "next level"
[2021-04-13T16:45:56.465Z]	<pete_M>	... so in the 101 we have discussed how to handle that
[2021-04-13T16:46:29.058Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	medium.com doesn't allow co-author attribution, which is why we need VCs for IP ASAP... ( https://sourcecheck.org )
[2021-04-13T16:46:33.927Z]	<pete_M>	George Lund: i personally want to understand this space outside of profession

[2021-04-13T16:46:56.617Z]	<pete_M>	... lots of people coming into the ecosystem need an understanding of this technical space

[2021-04-13T16:47:18.524Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	CCG101 is more than welcome to bang on the DIF's FAQ working draft here:

[2021-04-13T16:47:29.304Z]	<pete_M>	Kimberly_Linson: CCG 101 has identified a few topics we need help with from the CCG group
[2021-04-13T16:47:55.521Z]	<pete_M>	... "What is the path for first-time understanding?"
[2021-04-13T16:48:23.861Z]	<pete_M>	... there should be a collection of quality instruction/explanation
[2021-04-13T16:48:45.336Z]	<pete_M>	... "What does it mean to make a VC?"
[2021-04-13T16:49:24.339Z]	<pete_M>	... can the CCG 101 group see one built to lead us into additional questions?
[2021-04-13T16:49:28.996Z]	<George_Lund_(GDS)>	Just wanted to mention that we've already had great support from CCG members like Manu and Mike Prorock so thanks for that :-)
[2021-04-13T16:50:02.806Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: this community is built upon the collection of members/ people work
[2021-04-13T16:50:39.431Z]	<pete_M>	... the CCG group's goal is not to overburden anyone with jargon/ confusion
[2021-04-13T16:50:59.589Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	raw materials that may help CCG101 efforts (sorry I can't contribute directly until 1July) can be found linked here: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/CCG101/issues/3#issuecomment-818887263

[2021-04-13T16:52:48.572Z]	<pete_M>	mprorock: I'd be willing to commit some of my time, concerned about having a limited perspective on information
[2021-04-13T16:52:49.215Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	oh and anyone in the group is happy to crash my DIF "office hours" every week, they've been pretty dead lately anyways!

[2021-04-13T16:54:07.033Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	recorded VC-HTTP-API special call sounds like a GREAT format for generating very urgently needed educational support for that project/family of projects
[2021-04-13T16:55:00.894Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	the VC-EDU calls are a PARAGON of transparent, open schema design, fwiw
[2021-04-13T16:55:03.391Z]	<Manu_Sporny>	You can't give people a 2 hour heads up and expect people to be able to shift their schedules around, Juan -- need at least a few days of heads up
[2021-04-13T16:55:13.464Z]	<Juan_Caballero>	that's why I emailed last week

[2021-04-13T16:55:53.199Z]	<pete_M>	kimhd: VCs are difficult to completely understand for anyone new. This attempt to work with the CCG 101 group can be a good move
[2021-04-13T16:56:03.315Z]	<mprorock>	that would be perfect
[2021-04-13T16:56:48.131Z]	<pete_M>	heathervescent: any CCG 101 concerns?
[2021-04-13T16:57:31.330Z]	<pete_M>	... is there time to cover the next topic? Manu?

[2021-04-13T16:59:14.936Z]	<pete_M>	... prior scheduling makes next week difficult

[2021-04-13T17:02:21.073Z]	<pete_M>	... more specifically, <screenshare> the bottom part of a VC
[2021-04-13T17:02:47.523Z]	<pete_M>	... this is not a specifically a VC, this is more commonly datascience
[2021-04-13T17:03:38.100Z]	<pete_M>	... Ivan, thank you for the charter, the floor is yours
[2021-04-13T17:03:56.207Z]	<pete_M>	ivan: the plan is to have a very focused charter
[2021-04-13T17:04:49.255Z]	<pete_M>	... important to understand, this is not solely designed for VC work. This deals with semantic issues also
[2021-04-13T17:05:26.046Z]	<pete_M>	... we would like to organize the charter for the community-at-large, but the VC WG can benefit from the work

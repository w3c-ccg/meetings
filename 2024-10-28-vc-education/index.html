<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  For the verify potential future of education and Workforce hackathon um the the really nice thing about that is it lowers the barrier to entry to this hackathon track because it&apos;s a robust set of tools and um. <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Um you know specifications profiles that let people see how to get started so rather than build the all the tooling from scratch they have these components that they can just start using they can use a wallet or a test issuer things like that. <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  So um and then so building on that we carved out 3 um kind of I&apos;ll call them series of challenges. <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:   1 Is. <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Really based on the transformation enabled by decentralized identity Technologies and what can happen when people can own their working and learning records. <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  The second 1 is a set of tooling challenges and um sorry I may need to consult something read so I think we where we did that and Carrie chime in if I&apos;m missing it but the second 1 I think is focused on the um browser plug-in plus the uh with the what is it called the um learner credential wallet render method is that right Terry. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  The the Second Challenge is you&apos;re close you&apos;re very close um the Second Challenge is to build 1 um multiple language support I&apos;ll just read the the statement here to uh so it&apos;s multiple language support promote crossborder Mobility by enabling educational credentials to be meaningfully used internationally build a tool that constructs VCS in any language with a special emphasis on non-latin scripts and this is using the render method attribute. <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Other 1 is the browser integration and this is where we are thinking about how can we enhance convenience and usability um with a browser plug-in for displaying a verifying BCS and we&apos;re also thinking that render method would be um a great use a great application for this. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Great and then um the third 1 is the um I think that&apos;s where we have a learner credential wallet 1 and maybe something else. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Um yeah so we um we were this is sorry I didn&apos;t mean to interrupt you okay. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Actually this is where we also kind of putting an emphasis on render method 1 to um see if we could use render method to inform wallets how they should display credentials um we put this 1 in because we we know that there&apos;s like so many properties that could be displayed in a credential and it&apos;s a very small screen and 1 of the things that came out of plugfest was how do we how do we like how do we display the credentials in the way that makes sense they can&apos;t just display all the way all the the same way all the time right so in the learner credential wallet we are only right now displaying the required fields of open Badges and we know that there&apos;s a lot more that could be displayed so 1 of the the opportunities here is to test that out and to show us how you would do that um if you know if you want to do that and then the other 1 is doing something similar with verify or plus verify or plus is a web verifier for credentials and right now it also in other open source software um. <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:   From the DC. <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Now displaying you know the required elements of open badges 3.0 and we think there could be more that could be displayed in there and the render method seems to be a really interesting way to explore this and and those of you who aren&apos;t so interested so um informed about render method is it&apos;s a way to put a template inside of the signed credential that says hey here&apos;s like different ways that you could display this credential so it could be an array of templates it could be here&apos;s 1 for the wallet here&apos;s 1 for a PDF here&apos;s web from a web display and um we just want to see like how people would um implement this and and try this out. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Kerri Lemoie</span>:  Open Badges and for Education credentials. <a id="link-37" style="display:none;" href="#37">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-39').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-39').show()" id="39" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Chance you can get some good prices out of it we have a lot of prizes for you know each tier and honorable mentions so um it&apos;s really great way to get involved and you know refresh your your coding chops. <a id="link-39" style="display:none;" href="#39">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-40').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-40').show()" id="40" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  So yeah do we have any questions yet. <a id="link-40" style="display:none;" href="#40">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-41').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-41').show()" id="41" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Yeah um we use that for some of the projects that are you know bigger in Scopes to say like maybe the first maybe the first challenge set of of this track where they&apos;re wanting to work with others to you know maybe they&apos;re good at coding but they&apos;re not so good at designing or kind of organizing things end to end so um yeah we do have a challenge a a channel called find team I think in the Discord where people can advertise their availability and um you know sort of find other people with complimentary interest. <a id="link-41" style="display:none;" href="#41">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-42').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-42').show()" id="42" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  For a while 1 of the sponsors was uh Vitos was organizing a kind of form they had a forum link they probably still have it up where you can enter some more details about what tracks you&apos;re interested in what your skills are what you&apos;re looking for but um if you&apos;re wanting to just move fast to find a team channel is a good place to start. <a id="link-42" style="display:none;" href="#42">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-43').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-43').show()" id="43" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  None yet um the yeah we will only see at the end we will have a final um you know kind of uh what is it called the final award ceremony all of that where we&apos;ll get to see uh the winners and then also. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-44').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-44').show()" id="44" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  You know especially I think for this track it will be interesting to curate and reuse some for future jmf plugfest. <a id="link-44" style="display:none;" href="#44">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-45').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-45').show()" id="45" class="comment"><span class="name">Geun-Hyung Kim</span>:  Events so we did make sure that the uh source code license is you know mitt so it&apos;s permissive so we can reuse so I think that&apos;s 1 thing that we&apos;re really excited for with this track is the ability to benefit the whole line of jmf plugfest effort and and how this could benefit future ones um so yeah check in it keep checking in with us I think um a good way to stay up to date would be just joining the Discord and then also we can join uh the a VC edu call um in the future maybe you know I know you guys are are planned out for a while but um you know if we did something December uh something like that I think we would have enough information to come report back on what we found. <a id="link-45" style="display:none;" href="#45">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;ildiko_mazar&gt; I think that would be great to see some of these solutions demoed at one of our future calls</div>

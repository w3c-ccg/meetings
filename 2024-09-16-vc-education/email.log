<ildiko_mazar> Good morning, good afternoon everyone, welcome to 
  today's W3C Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call, 
  on Monday, September the 16th. Let's get started with the 
  housekeeping items. IP Note: Anyone can participate in these 
  calls. However, all substantive contributions to any Credentials 
  Community Group Work Items must originate from members of the CCG 
  with full IPR agreements signed. You can find the link to this in 
  the meeting invites, but please note that you'll need to have a 
  W3C account, but if you don't have one yet, it is also easy to 
  register one online. Moving on to call notes. Please note that 
  these meetings are recorded. We have a robot transcriber and we 
  also make audio and video recordings, that are archived and 
  available online. If you want to speak, please raise your hand, 
  or add yourself to the queue by typing “q+” in the chat. And 
  please be brief if you have a question to ask, we want to 
  maximise the time for conversations. Thank you. Now to 
  Introductions & Reintroductions. If we have any new people in the 
  call, or somebody would like to reintroduce themselves, please 
  feel free to take the floor. If nobody wants to take the floor, 
  we can move on to announcements and reminders. Anyone has events 
  or things that happened that people should be aware of, again, 
  please queue yourself up and share the news with us. Now to the 
  main agenda topic, that is Bridging Schemas & Translating Data. I 
  would like to welcome and invite our guest speakers Oran Dan and 
  Jelle Millenaar to take the floor.
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<susan_stroud> q
<phil_barker> Is anyone speaking? I hear nothing.
<pl> I'll be attending virtually, but not in person
<ildiko_mazar> @Phile Barker, there is a conversation you should 
  hear.
<phil_barker> Thanks Ildiko
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
Nate Otto:  Uh hi uh Nate here um thanks for the presentation 
  this is a pretty cool exciting um.
Nate Otto:  Technology that mode I contributed to the mapping on 
  the desm project in the spring that maybe you you pulled this 
  particular mapping and I was um just curious if you had any 
  additional thoughts about uh the desm tool or its road map like 
  for example I don't even know how to extract the mapping file 
  that you used as an input here um.
Nate Otto:  Was there any like difficulty or or enthusiasm around 
  working with desam is it the right tool to do this sort of 
  mappings that are in input to this project.
<phil_barker> @Nate, the public output is a new feature, it's at 
  the top of the mapping page: 
  https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list?cp=6&abstractClass=Assertion
Nate Otto:  Great thank you for that.
<sharon_leu> Wondering which are the obv3 elements that don't 
  exist on the other end?
Sheela_Kiiskila: Uh thank you for the wonderful presentation and 
  uh uh maybe this is a wrong question to ask but I'll ask anyway 
  so you you said this is based on um verifiable Elm model and and 
  verifiable credentials uh I was wondering uh we use European 
  digital credentials uh to give to the students and uh is it 
  possible to map from the EDC if we want to use open Badges and 
  give a badge you know as a progression or or or uh uh along with 
  the EDC is that a possibility to just when we issue the EDC we 
  can also use a mapping tool to extract a badge and issue.
<pl> We don't hear Oran
<ildiko_mazar> :-O
<phil_barker> I hear him!
<pl> Thanks Phil B. not sure how I lost audio
<ildiko_mazar> Me too.
Sheela_Kiiskila: Thank you yeah not to issue but once we issue we 
  EC and issue them it would be nice to extract information from it 
  and also issue a badge without uh doing it.
Sheela_Kiiskila: Okay thank you.
<ildiko_mazar> That's an interesting question in itself - 
  extracting data from a signed credential and resign in a 
  different format.
<ronald_ham> @ Iloilo that is exactly what we are trying to 
  achieve in DC4EU with all the partners in our Working package
<ronald_ham> I meant @Ildiko
<ildiko_mazar> :+1:
<phil_barker> q
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> we are happy to collaborate, 
  and if you are talking to Phil Barker, he is working directly 
  with us
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> love seeing that this work is 
  expanding and exploring additional use cases!
Sheela_Kiiskila: Sorry I forgot to remove myself from the queue.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> I would think that this tool 
  is useful for "translating" a holder's credentials even if they 
  are not re-issued in a different schema
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: Oh yeah sorry I uh shop also from in 
  technology that did this project um I just wanted to um mention 
  that we're very happy to collaborate with this project that's 
  really our goal.
<ildiko_mazar> If you are joining the 1EdTech conference, the 
  session I was referring to is on Friday 11-Oct. Read more at 
  https://web.cvent.com/event/7fa940bb-8b8e-42f0-b02e-baf9e909ff1c/websitePage:b02ad9d9-260b-4530-bdd2-b863dbc3921f?session=a095db2d-5234-471e-b3c0-48e5ec15902b&shareLink=true
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: Um the debt is already uh putting 
  some really uh good points in the chat about how this uh can be 
  used and is can work in several occasions and that's exactly how 
  we view this as well that this can be a tool that brings 
  communities uh of different issuers and verifiers more together 
  because you no longer need to think about the technical 
  implementation of supporting multiple formats right like this 
  kind of tool is trying to take away those problems and make sure 
  that if there's a community really focused on creating Elm 
  credentials and another 1 on open badges that they're not limited 
  by these 2 different standards but rather that we can start to.
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> +1!
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: Combine and interact with each other.
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: The similarly we also would like to 
  do that with this kind of project right try to utilize the maps 
  that has made and not reinvented ourselves and work with other 
  solutions that are out there uh and combine that and make it 
  something more promising and more and more valuable for all of 
  all of us so if you're interested in this project and you would 
  like to further talk to us about it or collaborate collaborate 
  with us uh on that that's an open invite for everyone and feel 
  free to uh to contact us uh at any time.
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: Yeah thank you for that question as 
  well uh so for now uh we have indeed uh finished the first 
  version of this uh of this project as far as it is funded um we 
  absolutely have the intention to uh maintain it and expand it a 
  little bit and uh uh completely integrated into our own product 
  so you can indeed not just uh uh convert a credential but then 
  also reissue it using our software uh but in the end uh there 
  there still a lot more opportunities that can be done with this 
  um and yeah for that we are absolutely looking for partners or 
  grants uh grant opportunities to expand on this because yeah 
  there's a lot of cool ideas out there um but yeah we're an open 
  source uh development organization so we're looking for those 
  opportunities in their.
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: Yes so thanks for that question.
<dmitri_zagidulin> do you mind adding links to the Github repos 
  for these tools?
https://github.com/impierce/credential-converter
<dmitri_zagidulin> thanks! :)
<jelle_millenaar_[impierce]> Coverter: 
  https://github.com/impierce/credential-converter
<ildiko_mazar> Star already given after first encounter :-)
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: I just added some of the other repos 
  we've also briefly mentioned our European identity wallet and 
  also the identity agent that can be used for issuing these type 
  of credentials um so.
<dmitri_zagidulin> perfect!
Jelle_Millenaar_[Impierce]: If you're interested in that as well 
  the links are there.
Sheela_Kiiskila: I was clapping and I think it took mistook me.
<sharon_leu> Thank you!
<deb_everhart_(credential_engine)> thanks all!
<sheela_kiiskila> thank you

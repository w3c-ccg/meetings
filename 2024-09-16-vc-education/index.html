<div class="information">&lt;ildiko_mazar&gt; Good morning, good afternoon everyone, welcome to today&apos;s W3C Verifiable Credentials for Education task force call, on Monday, September the 16th. Let&apos;s get started with the housekeeping items. IP Note: Anyone can participate in these calls. However, all substantive contributions to any Credentials Community Group Work Items must originate from members of the CCG with full IPR agreements signed. You can find the link to this in the meeting invites, but please note that you&apos;ll need to have a W3C account, but if you don&apos;t have one yet, it is also easy to register one online. Moving on to call notes. Please note that these meetings are recorded. We have a robot transcriber and we also make audio and video recordings, that are archived and available online. If you want to speak, please raise your hand, or add yourself to the queue by typing &#8220;q+&#8221; in the chat. And please be brief if you have a question to ask, we want to maximise the time for conversations. Thank you. Now to Introductions &amp; Reintroductions. If we have any new people in the call, or somebody would like to reintroduce themselves, please feel free to take the floor. If nobody wants to take the floor, we can move on to announcements and reminders. Anyone has events or things that happened that people should be aware of, again, please queue yourself up and share the news with us. Now to the main agenda topic, that is Bridging Schemas &amp; Translating Data. I would like to welcome and invite our guest speakers Oran Dan and Jelle Millenaar to take the floor.</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-2').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-2').show()" id="2" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Technology that mode I contributed to the mapping on the desm project in the spring that maybe you you pulled this particular mapping and I was um just curious if you had any additional thoughts about uh the desm tool or its road map like for example I don&apos;t even know how to extract the mapping file that you used as an input here um. <a id="link-2" style="display:none;" href="#2">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Nate Otto</span>:  Was there any like difficulty or or enthusiasm around working with desam is it the right tool to do this sort of mappings that are in input to this project. <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;phil_barker&gt; @Nate, the public output is a new feature, it&apos;s at the top of the mapping page: <a href="https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list?cp=6&amp;abstractClass=Assertion">https://desm.credentialengine.org/mappings-list?cp=6&amp;abstractClass=Assertion</a></div>

<div class="information">&lt;pl&gt; We don&apos;t hear Oran</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-6').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-6').show()" id="6" class="information">Sheela_Kiiskila: Thank you yeah not to issue but once we issue we EC and issue them it would be nice to extract information from it and also issue a badge without uh doing it. <a id="link-6" style="display:none;" href="#6">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-201').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-201').show()" id="201" class="information">Wolf_McNally: Also to add that uh I also like to add a couple things you know 1 um Christopher touched on it but you know blockchain Commons despite the name of our organization is not focused exclusively on the blockchain space at all it&apos;s focused on the uh personal um sovereignty digital privacy human rights space and how Technologies can be best used for that uh the name itself came about when blockchain was the chief way that was actually being kind of advanced but you know our mission itself has always been broader than blockchain based per cell itself so um and the other thing that. <a id="link-201" style="display:none;" href="#201">✪</a></div>
